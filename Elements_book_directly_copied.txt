PREFACE.
This edition of the Elements of Euclid, undertaken at the request of the principals of some of the leading Colleges and Schools of Ireland, is intended to
supply a want much felt by teachers at the present day—the production of a
work which, while giving the unrivalled original in all its integrity, would also
contain the modern conceptions and developments of the portion of Geometry
over which the Elements extend. A cursory examination of the work will show
that the Editor has gone much further in this latter direction than any of his
predecessors, for it will be found to contain, not only more actual matter than
is given in any of theirs with which he is acquainted, but also much of a special
character, which is not given, so far as he is aware, in any former work on the
subject. The great extension of geometrical methods in recent times has made
such a work a necessity for the student, to enable him not only to read with advantage, but even to understand those mathematical writings of modern times
which require an accurate knowledge of Elementary Geometry, and to which it
is in reality the best introduction.
In compiling his work the Editor has received invaluable assistance from the
late Rev. Professor Townsend, s.f.t.c.d. The book was rewritten and considerably altered in accordance with his suggestions, and to that distinguished
Geometer it is largely indebted for whatever merit it possesses.
The Questions for Examination in the early part of the First Book are intended as specimens, which the teacher ought to follow through the entire work.
Every person who has had experience in tuition knows well the importance of
such examinations in teaching Elementary Geometry.
The Exercises, of which there are over eight hundred, have been all selected
with great care. Those in the body of each Book are intended as applications of
Euclid’s Propositions. They are for the most part of an elementary character,
and may be regarded as common property, nearly every one of them having
appeared already in previous collections. The Exercises at the end of each
Book are more advanced; several are due to the late Professor Townsend, some
are original, and a large number have been taken from two important French
works—Catalan’s Th´eor`emes et Probl`emes de G´eom´etrie El´ementaire, and
the Trait´e de G´eom´etrie, by Rouche´ and De Comberousse.
The second edition has been thoroughly revised and greatly enlarged. The
new matter includes several alternative proofs, important examination questions
on each of the books, an explanation of the ratio of incommensurable quantities,
the first twenty-one propositions of Book XI., and an Appendix on the properties
of the Prism, Pyramids, Cylinder, Sphere, and Cone.
The present Edition has been very carefully read throughout, and it is hoped
that few misprints have escaped detection.
The Editor is glad to find from the rapid sale of former editions (each 3000
copies) of his Book, and its general adoption in schools, that it is likely to
i
accomplish the double object with which it was written, viz. to supply students
with a Manual that will impart a thorough knowledge of the immortal work
of the great Greek Geometer, and introduce them, at the same time, to some
of the most important conceptions and developments of the Geometry of the
present day.

THE ELEMENTS OF EUCLID.
INTRODUCTION.
Geometry is the Science of figured Space. Figured Space is of one, two, or three
dimensions, according as it consists of lines, surfaces, or solids. The boundaries
of solids are surfaces; of surfaces, lines; and of lines, points. Thus it is the
province of Geometry to investigate the properties of solids, of surfaces, and
of the figures described on surfaces. The simplest of all surfaces is the plane,
and that department of Geometry which is occupied with the lines and curves
drawn on a plane is called Plane Geometry; that which demonstrates the properties of solids, of curved surfaces, and the figures described on curved surfaces,
is Geometry of Three Dimensions. The simplest lines that can be drawn on a
plane are the right line and circle, and the study of the properties of the point,
the right line, and the circle, is the introduction to Geometry, of which it forms
an extensive and important department. This is the part of Geometry on which
the oldest Mathematical Book in existence, namely, Euclid’s Elements, is written, and is the subject of the present volume. The conic sections and other
curves that can be described on a plane form special branches, and complete
the divisions of this, the most comprehensive of all the Sciences. The student
will find in Chasles’ Aper¸cu Historique a valuable history of the origin and the
development of the methods of Geometry.
In the following work, when figures are not drawn, the student should construct them from the given directions. The Propositions of Euclid will be printed
in larger type, and will be referred to by Roman numerals enclosed in brackets.
Thus [III. xxxii.] will denote the 32nd Proposition of the 3rd Book. The number of the Book will be given only when different from that under which the
reference occurs. The general and the particular enunciation of every Proposition will be given in one. By omitting the letters enclosed in parentheses we
have the general enunciation, and by reading them, the particular. The annotations will be printed in smaller type. The following symbols will be used in
them:—
Circle will be denoted by J
Triangle ,, 4
Parallelogram ,,
Parallel lines ,, k
Perpendicular ,, ?
In addition to these we shall employ the usual symbols +, ?, &c. of Algebra,
and also the sign of congruence, namely ?. This symbol has been introduced
by the illustrious Gauss.

BOOK I.
THEORY OF ANGLES, TRIANGLES, PARALLEL LINES, AND
PARALLELOGRAMS.
DEFINITIONS.
The Point.
i. A point is that which has position but not dimensions.
A geometrical magnitude which has three dimensions, that is, length, breadth, and thickness, is a solid; that which has two dimensions, such as length and breadth, is a surface; and
that which has but one dimension is a line. But a point is neither a solid, nor a surface, nor
a line; hence it has no dimensions—that is, it has neither length, breadth, nor thickness.
The Line.
ii. A line is length without breadth.
A line is space of one dimension. If it had any breadth, no matter how small, it would
be space of two dimensions; and if in addition it had any thickness it would be space of three
dimensions; hence a line has neither breadth nor thickness.
iii. The intersections of lines and their extremities are points.
iv. A line which lies evenly between its extreme
points is called a straight or right line, such as AB.
If a point move without changing its direction it will describe a right line. The direction in
which a point moves in called its “sense.” If the moving point continually changes its direction
it will describe a curve; hence it follows that only one right line can be drawn between two
points. The following Illustration is due to Professor Henrici:—“If we suspend a weight by a
string, the string becomes stretched, and we say it is straight, by which we mean to express
that it has assumed a peculiar definite shape. If we mentally abstract from this string all
thickness, we obtain the notion of the simplest of all lines, which we call a straight line.”
The Plane.
v. A surface is that which has length and breadth.
A surface is space of two dimensions. It has no thickness, for if it had any, however small,
it would be space of three dimensions.
vi. When a surface is such that the right line joining any two arbitrary
points in it lies wholly in the surface, it is called a plane.
A plane is perfectly flat and even, like the surface of still water, or of a smooth floor.—
Newcomb.
2
Figures.
vii. Any combination of points, of lines, or of points and lines in a plane, is
called a plane figure. If a figure be formed of points only it is called a stigmatic
figure; and if of right lines only, a rectilineal figure.
viii. Points which lie on the same right line are called collinear points. A
figure formed of collinear points is called a row of points.
The Angle.
ix. The inclination of two right lines extending out from one point in different
directions is called a rectilineal angle.
x. The two lines are called the legs, and the point the vertex of the angle.
A light line drawn from the vertex and turning about it
in the plane of the angle, from the position of coincidence
with one leg to that of coincidence with the other, is said to
turn through the angle, and the angle is the greater as the
quantity of turning is the greater. Again, since the line may
turn from one position to the other in either of two ways,
two angles are formed by two lines drawn from a point.
Thus if AB, AC be the legs, a line may turn from the
position AB to the position AC in the two ways indicated
by the arrows. The smaller of the angles thus formed is to be
understood as the angle contained by the lines. The larger,
called a re-entrant angle, seldom occurs in the “Elements.”
xi. Designation of Angles.—A particular angle in a figure is denoted by
three letters, as BAC, of which the middle one, A, is at the vertex, and the
other two along the legs. The angle is then read BAC.
xii. The angle formed by joining two or more angles together is called
their sum. Thus the sum of the two angles ABC, P QR is the angle AB0R,
formed by applying the side QP to the side BC,
so that the vertex Q shall fall on the vertex B,
and the side QR on the opposite side of BC
from BA.
xiii. When the sum of two angles BAC,
CAD is such that the legs BA, AD form one
right line, they are called supplements of each
other.
Hence, when one line stands on another, the two angles which it makes on the same side
of that on which it stands are supplements of each other.
3
xiv. When one line stands on another, and
makes the adjacent angles at both sides of itself
equal, each of the angles is called a right angle,
and the line which stands on the other is called a
perpendicular to it.
Hence a right angle is equal to its supplement.
xv. An acute angle is one which is less than
a right angle, as A.
xvi. An obtuse angle is one which is greater than a right angle, as BAC.
The supplement of an acute angle is obtuse, and conversely, the supplement of an obtuse
angle is acute.
xvii. When the sum of two angles is a right angle,
each is called the complement of the other. Thus, if
the angle BAC be right, the angles BAD, DAC are
complements of each other.
Concurrent Lines.
xviii. Three or more right lines passing through
the same point are called concurrent lines.
xix. A system of more than three concurrent lines is called a pencil of lines.
Each line of a pencil is called a ray, and the common point through which the
rays pass is called the vertex .
The Triangle.
xx. A triangle is a figure formed by three right lines joined end to end. The
three lines are called its sides.
xxi. A triangle whose three sides are unequal is said to be scalene, as A;
a triangle having two sides equal, to be isosceles, as B; and and having all its
sides equal, to be equilateral, as C.
xxii. A right-angled triangle is one that has one of its angles a right angle,
as D. The side which subtends the right angle is called the hypotenuse.
4
xxiii. An obtuse-angled triangle is one that has one of its angles obtuse, as
E.
xxiv. An acute-angled triangle is one that has its three angles acute, as F.
xxv. An exterior angle of a triangle is one that is formed by any side and
the continuation of another side.
Hence a triangle has six exterior angles; and also each exterior angle is the supplement of
the adjacent interior angle.
The Polygon.
xxvi. A rectilineal figure bounded by more than three right lines is usually
called a polygon.
xxvii. A polygon is said to be convex when it has no re-entrant angle.
xxviii. A polygon of four sides is called a quadrilateral.
xxix. A quadrilateral whose four sides are equal is called a lozenge.
xxx. A lozenge which has a right angle is called a square.
xxxi. A polygon which has five sides is called a pentagon; one which has six
sides, a hexagon, and so on.
The Circle.
xxxii. A circle is a plane figure formed by a curved
line called the circumference, and is such that all right
lines drawn from a certain point within the figure to the
circumference are equal to one another. This point is
called the centre.
xxxiii. A radius of a circle is any right line drawn
from the centre to the circumference, such as CD.
xxxiv. A diameter of a circle is a right line drawn through the centre and
terminated both ways by the circumference, such as AB.
From the definition of a circle it follows at once that the path of a movable point in a
plane which remains at a constant distance from a fixed point is a circle; also that any point
P in the plane is inside, outside, or on the circumference of a circle according as its distance
from the centre is less than, greater than, or equal to, the radius.
Postulates.
Let it be granted that—
i. A right line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.
When we consider a straight line contained between two fixed points which are its ends,
such a portion is called a finite straight line.
ii. A terminated right line may be produced to any length in a right line.
5
Every right line may extend without limit in either direction or in both. It is in these
cases called an indefinite line. By this postulate a finite right line may be supposed to be
produced, whenever we please, into an indefinite right line.
iii. A circle may be described from any centre, and with any distance from
that centre as radius.
If there be two points A and B, and if with any instruments,
such as a ruler and pen, we draw a line from A to B, this will
evidently have some irregularities, and also some breadth and
thickness. Hence it will not be a geometrical line no matter how nearly it may approach to
one. This is the reason that Euclid postulates the drawing of a right line from one point to
another. For if it could be accurately done there would be no need for his asking us to let it be
granted. Similar observations apply to the other postulates. It is also worthy of remark that
Euclid never takes for granted the doing of anything for which a geometrical construction,
founded on other problems or on the foregoing postulates, can be given.
Axioms.
i. Things which are equal to the same, or to equals, are equal to each other.
Thus, if there be three things, and if the first, and the second, be each equal to the third,
we infer by this axiom that the first is equal to the second. This axiom relates to all kinds of
magnitude. The same is true of Axioms ii., iii., iv., v., vi., vii., ix.; but viii., x., xi., xii., are
strictly geometrical.
ii. If equals be added to equals the sums will be equal.
iii. If equals be taken from equals the remainders will be equal.
iv. If equals be added to unequals the sums will be unequal.
v. If equals be taken from unequals the remainders will be unequal.
vi. The doubles of equal magnitudes are equal.
vii. The halves of equal magnitudes are equal.
viii. Magnitudes that can be made to coincide are equal.
The placing of one geometrical magnitude on another, such as a line on a line, a triangle
on a triangle, or a circle on a circle, &c., is called superposition. The superposition employed
in Geometry is only mental, that is, we conceive one magnitude placed on the other; and
then, if we can prove that they coincide, we infer, by the present axiom, that they are equal.
Superposition involves the following principle, of which, without explicitly stating it, Euclid
makes frequent use:—“Any figure may be transferred from one position to another without
change of form or size.”
ix. The whole is greater than its part.
This axiom is included in the following, which is a fuller statement:—
ix0
. The whole is equal to the sum of all its parts.
x. Two right lines cannot enclose a space.
This is equivalent to the statement, “If two right lines have two points common to both,
they coincide in direction,” that is, they form but one line, and this holds true even when one
of the points is at infinity.
xi. All right angles are equal to one another.
This can be proved as follows:—Let there be two right lines AB, CD, and two perpendiculars to them, namely, EF, GH, then if AB, CD be made to coincide by superposition, so
that the point E will coincide with G; then since a right angle is equal to its supplement, the
line EF must coincide with GH. Hence the angle AEF is equal to CGH.
xii. If two right lines (AB, CD) meet a third line (AC), so as to make the
sum of the two interior angles (BAC, ACD) on the same side less than two
right angles, these lines being produced shall meet at some finite distance.
6
This axiom is the converse of Prop. xvii., Book I.
Explanation of Terms.
Axioms.—“Elements of human reason,” according to Dugald Stewart, are
certain general propositions, the truths of which are self-evident, and which are
so fundamental, that they cannot be inferred from any propositions which are
more elementary; in other words, they are incapable of demonstration. “That
two sides of a triangle are greater than the third” is, perhaps, self-evident; but
it is not an axiom, inasmuch as it can be inferred by demonstration from other
propositions; but we can give no proof of the proposition that “things which are
equal to the same are equal to one another,” and, being self-evident, it is an
axiom.
Propositions which are not axioms are properties of figures obtained by processes of reasoning. They are divided into theorems and problems.
A Theorem is the formal statement of a property that may be demonstrated
from known propositions. These propositions may themselves be theorems or
axioms. A theorem consists of two parts, the hypothesis, or that which is assumed, and the conclusion, or that which is asserted to follow therefrom. Thus,
in the typical theorem,
If X is Y, then Z is W, (i.)
the hypothesis is that X is Y , and the conclusion is that Z is W.
Converse Theorems.—Two theorems are said to be converse, each of the
other, when the hypothesis of either is the conclusion of the other. Thus the
converse of the theorem (i.) is—
If Z is W, then X is Y. (ii.)
From the two theorems (i.) and (ii.) we may infer two others, called their
contrapositives. Thus the contrapositive
of (i.) is, If Z is not W, then X is not Y ; (iii.)
of (ii.) is, If X is not Y , then Z is not W. (iv.)
The theorem (iv.) is called the obverse of (i.), and (iii.) the obverse of (ii.).
A Problem is a proposition in which something is proposed to be done, such
as a line to be drawn, or a figure to be constructed, under some given conditions.
7
The Solution of a problem is the method of construction which accomplishes
the required end.
The Demonstration is the proof, in the case of a theorem, that the conclusion
follows from the hypothesis; and in the case of a problem, that the construction
accomplishes the object proposed.
The Enunciation of a problem consists of two parts, namely, the data, or
things supposed to be given, and the quaesita, or things required to be done.
Postulates are the elements of geometrical construction, and occupy the same
relation with respect to problems as axioms do to theorems.
A Corollary is an inference or deduction from a proposition.
A Lemma is an auxiliary proposition required in the demonstration of a
principal proposition.
A Secant or Transversal is a line which cuts a system of lines, a circle, or
any other geometrical figure.
Congruent figures are those that can be made to coincide by superposition. They agree in shape and size, but differ in position. Hence it follows,
by Axiom viii., that corresponding parts or portions of congruent figures are
congruent, and that congruent figures are equal in every respect.
Rule of Identity.—Under this name the following principle will be sometimes
referred to:—“If there is but one X and one Y , then, from the fact that X is
Y , it necessarily follows that Y is X.”—Syllabus.
PROP. I.—Problem.
On a given finite right line (AB) to construct an equilateral triangle.
Sol.—With A as centre, and AB
as radius, describe the circle BCD
(Post. iii.). With B as centre, and BA
as radius, describe the circle ACE, cutting the former circle in C. Join CA,
CB (Post. i.). Then ABC is the equilateral triangle required.
Dem.—Because A is the centre of
the circle BCD, AC is equal to AB
(Def. xxxii.). Again, because B is the
centre of the circle ACE, BC is equal to BA. Hence we have proved.
AC = AB,
and BC = AB.
But things which are equal to the same are equal to one another (Axiom i.);
therefore AC is equal to BC; therefore the three lines AB, BC, CA are equal
to one another. Hence the triangle ABC is equilateral (Def. xxi.); and it is
described on the given line AB, which was required to be done.

Exercises.
The following exercises are to be solved when the pupil has mastered the First Book:—
1. If the lines AF, BF be joined, the figure ACBF is a lozenge.
2. If AB be produced to D and E, the triangles CDF and CEF are equilateral.
3. If CA, CB be produced to meet the circles again in G and H, the points G, F, H are
collinear, and the triangle GCH is equilateral.
4. If CF be joined, CF2 = 3AB2
.
5. Describe a circle in the space ACB, bounded by the line AB and the two circles.
PROP. II.—Problem.
From a given point (A) to draw a right line equal to a given finite right line
(BC).
Sol.—Join AB (Post. i.); on AB describe the equilateral triangle ABD [i.].
With B as centre, and BC as radius, describe the circle ECH (Post iii.). Produce DB to meet the circle ECH in E
(Post. ii.). With D as centre, and DE as
radius, describe the circle EF G (Post. iii.).
Produce DA to meet this circle in F. AF
is equal to BC.
Dem.—Because D is the centre of
the circle EF G, DF is equal to DE
(Def. xxxii.). And because DAB is an
equilateral triangle, DA is equal to DB
(Def. xxi.). Hence we have
DF = DE,
and DA = DB;
and taking the latter from the former, the remainder AF is equal to the remainder BE (Axiom iii.). Again, because B is the centre of the circle ECH, BC is
equal to BE; and we have proved that AF is equal to BE; and things which
are equal to the same thing are equal to one another (Axiom i.). Hence AF
9
is equal to BC. Therefore from the given point A the line AF has been drawn
equal to BC.
It is usual with commentators on Euclid to say that he allows the use of the rule and
compass. Were such the case this Proposition would have been unnecessary. The fact is,
Euclid’s object was to teach Theoretical and not Practical Geometry, and the only things
he postulates are the drawing of right lines and the describing of circles. If he allowed the
mechanical use of the rule and compass he could give methods of solving many problems that
go beyond the limits of the “geometry of the point, line, and circle.”—See Notes D, F at the
end of this work.
Exercises.
1. Solve the problem when the point A is in the line BC itself.
2. Inflect from a given point A to a given line BC a line equal to a given line. State the
number of solutions.
PROP. III.—Problem.
From the greater (AB) of two given right lines to cut off a part equal to (C)
the less.
Sol.—From A, one of the extremities of
AB, draw the right line AD equal to C [ii.];
and with A as centre, and AD as radius, describe the circle EDF (Post. iii.) cutting AB
in E. AE shall be equal to C.
Dem.—Because A is the centre of the circle
EDF, AE is equal to AD (Def. xxxii.), and
C is equal to AD (const.); and things which
are equal to the same are equal to one another
(Axiom i.); therefore AE is equal to C. Wherefore from AB, the greater of the two given lines, a part, AE, has been out off
equal to C, the less.
Questions for Examination.
1. What previous problem is employed in the solution of this?
2. What postulate?
3. What axiom in the demonstration?
4. Show how to produce the less of two given lines until the whole produced line becomes
equal to the greater.
PROP. IV.—Theorem.
If two triangles (BAC, EDF) have two sides (BA, AC) of one equal respectively to two sides (ED, DF) of the other, and have also the angles (A, D)
included by those sides equal, the triangles shall be equal in every respect—that
is, their bases or third sides (BC, EF) shall be equal, and the angles (B, C)
at the base of one shall be respectively equal to the angles (E, F) at the base of
the other; namely, those shall be equal to which the equal sides are opposite.
10
Dem.—Let us conceive the triangle
BAC to be applied to EDF, so that the
point A shall coincide with D, and the
line AB with DE, and that the point C
shall be on the same side of DE as F;
then because AB is equal to DE, the
point B shall coincide with E. Again,
because the angle BAC is equal to the
angle EDF, the line AC shall coincide with DF; and since AC is equal to DF
(hyp.), the point C shall coincide with F; and we have proved that the point B
coincides with E. Hence two points of the line BC coincide with two points of
the line EF; and since two right lines cannot enclose a space, BC must coincide
with EF. Hence the triangles agree in every respect; therefore BC is equal to
EF, the angle B is equal to the angle E, the angle C to the angle F, and the
triangle BAC to the triangle EDF.
Questions for Examination.

They are said to be congruent.
4. What is meant by superposition?
5. What axiom is made use of in superposition?
6. How many parts in a triangle? Ans. Six; namely, three sides and three angles.
7. When it is required to prove that two triangles are congruent, how many parts of one
must be given equal to corresponding parts of the other? Ans. In general, any three except
the three angles. This will be established in Props. viii. and xxvi., taken along with iv.
8. What property of two lines having two common points is quoted in this Proposition?
They must coincide.
Exercises.
1. The line that bisects the vertical angle of an isosceles triangle bisects the base perpendicularly.
2. If two adjacent sides of a quadrilateral be equal, and the diagonal bisects the angle
between them, their other sides are equal.
3. If two lines be at right angles, and if each bisect the other, then any point in either is
equally distant from the extremities of the other.
4. If equilateral triangles be described on the sides of any triangle, the distances between
the vertices of the original triangle and the opposite vertices of the equilateral triangles are
equal. (This Proposition should be proved after the student has read Prop. xxxii.)
PROP. V.—Theorem.
The angles (ABC, ACB) at the base (BC) of an isosceles triangle are equal
to one another, and if the equal sides (AB, AC) be produced, the external angles
(DEC, ECB) below the base shall be equal.
11
Dem.—In BD take any point F, and from
AE, the greater, cut off AG equal to AF [iii].
Join BG, CF (Post. i.). Because AF is equal to
AG (const.), and AC is equal to AB (hyp.), the
two triangles F AC, GAB have the sides F A,
AC in one respectively equal to the sides GA,
AB in the other; and the included angle A is
common to both triangles. Hence [iv.] the base
F C is equal to GB, the angle AF C is equal to
AGB, and the angle ACF is equal to the angle
ABG.
Again, because AF is equal to AG (const.),
and AB to AC (hyp.), the remainder, BF, is equal to CG (Axiom iii); and we
have proved that F C is equal to GB, and the angle BF C equal to the angle
CGB. Hence the two triangles BF C, CGB have the two sides BF, F C in one
equal to the two sides CG, GB in the other; and the angle BF C contained
by the two sides of one equal to the angle CGB contained by the two sides
of the other. Therefore [iv.] these triangles have the angle F BC equal to the
angle GCB, and these are the angles below the base. Also the angle F CB equal
to GBC; but the whole angle F CA has been proved equal to the whole angle
GBA. Hence the remaining angle ACB is equal to the remaining angle ABC,
and these are the angles at the base.
Observation.—The great difficulty which beginners find in this Proposition is due to the fact
that the two triangles ACF, ABG overlap each
other. The teacher should make these triangles separate, as in the annexed diagram, and point out the
corresponding parts thus:—
AF = AG,
AC = AB;
angle F AC = angle GAB.
Hence [iv.], angle ACF = angle ABG.
and angle AF C = angle AGB.
The student should also be shown how to apply one of the triangles to the other, so as to
bring them into coincidence. Similar Illustrations may be given of the triangles BF C, CGB.
The following is a very easy proof of this Proposition.
Conceive the 4 ACB to be turned, without alteration, round
the line AC, until it falls on the other side. Let ACD be its
new position; then the angle ADC of the displaced triangle
is evidently equal to the angle ABC, with which it originally
coincided. Again, the two 4s BAC, CAD have the sides
BA, AC of one respectively equal to the sides AC, AD of
the other, and the included angles equal; therefore [iv.] the
angle ACB opposite to the side AB is equal to the angle
ADC opposite to the side AC; but the angle ADC is equal
to ABC; therefore ACB is equal to ABC.
Cor.—Every equilateral triangle is equiangular.
12
Def.—A line in any figure, such as AC in the preceding diagram, which is
such that, by folding the plane of the figure round it, one part of the diagram
will coincide with the other, is called an axis of symmetry of the figure.
Exercises.
1. Prove that the angles at the base are equal without producing the sides. Also by
producing the sides through the vertex.
2. Prove that the line joining the point A to the intersection of the lines CF and BG is
an axis of symmetry of the figure.
3. If two isosceles triangles be on the same base, and be either at the same or at opposite
sides of it, the line joining their vertices is an axis of symmetry of the figure formed by them.
4. Show how to prove this Proposition by assuming as an axiom that every angle has a
bisector.
5. Each diagonal of a lozenge is an axis of symmetry of the lozenge.
6. If three points be taken on the sides of an equilateral triangle, namely, one on each side,
at equal distances from the angles, the lines joining them form a new equilateral triangle.
PROP. VI.—Theorem.
If two angles (B, C) of a triangle be equal, the sides (AC, AB) opposite to
them are also equal.
Dem.—If AB, AC are not equal, one must be greater
than the other. Suppose AB is the greater, and that the
part BD is equal to AC. Join CD (Post. i.). Then the
two triangles DBC, ACB have BD equal to AC, and BC
common to both. Therefore the two sides DB, BC in one
are equal to the two sides AC, CB in the other; and the
angle DBC in one is equal to the angle ACB in the other
(hyp). Therefore [iv.] the triangle DBC is equal to the
triangle ACB—the less to the greater, which is absurd; hence AC, AB are not
unequal, that is, they are equal.

8. What does this assumption lead to?
PROP. VII—Theorem.
If two triangles (ACB, ADB) on the same base (AB) and on the same side
of it have one pair of conterminous sides (AC, AD) equal to one another, the
other pair of conterminous sides (BC, BD) must be unequal.
13
Dem.—1. Let the vertex of each triangle be without
the other. Join CD. Then because AD is equal to AC
(hyp.), the triangle ACD is isosceles; therefore [v.] the
angle ACD is equal to the angle ADC; but ADC is greater
than BDC (Axiom ix.); therefore ACD is greater than
BDC: much, more is BCD greater than BDC. Now if the
side BD were equal to BC, the angle BCD would be equal
to BDC [v.]; but it has been proved to be greater. Hence
BD is not equal to BC.
2. Let the vertex of one triangle ADB
fall within the other triangle ACB. Produce the sides AC, AD to E and F.
Then because AC is equal to AD (hyp.),
the triangle ACD is isosceles, and [v.]
the external angles ECD, F DC at the
other side of the base CD are equal; but
ECD is greater than BCD (Axiom ix.).
Therefore F DC is greater than BCD:
much more is BDC greater than BCD;
but if BC were equal to BD, the angle BDC would be equal to BCD [v.];
therefore BC cannot be equal to BD.
3. If the vertex D of the second triangle fall on the line BC, it is evident
that BC and BD are unequal.
Questions for Examination.
1. What use is made of Prop. vii.? Ans. As a lemma to Prop. viii.
2. In the demonstration of Prop. vii. the contrapositive of Prop. v. occurs; show where.
3. Show that two circles can intersect each other only in one point on the same side of
the line joining their centres, and hence that two circles cannot have more than two points of
intersection.
PROP. VIII.—Theorem.
If two triangles (ABC, DEF) have
two sides (AB, AC) of one respectively
equal to two sides (DE, DF) of the
other, and have also the base (BC) of
one equal to the base (EF) of the other;
then the two triangles shall be equal, and
the angles of one shall be respectively
equal to the angles of the other—namely,
those shall be equal to which the equal sides are opposite.
Dem.—Let the triangle ABC be applied to DEF, so that the point B will
coincide with E, and the line BC with the line EF; then because BC is equal
to EF, the point C shall coincide with F. Then if the vertex A fall on the same
14
side of EF as the vertex D, the point A must coincide with D; for if not, let
it take a different position G; then we have EG equal to BA, and BA is equal
to ED (hyp.). Hence (Axiom i.) EG is equal to ED: in like manner, F G is
equal to F D, and this is impossible [vii.]. Hence the point A must coincide with
D, and the triangle ABC agrees in every respect with the triangle DEF; and
therefore the three angles of one are respectively equal to the three angles of the
other—namely, A to D, B to E, and C to F, and the two triangles are equal.
This Proposition is the converse of iv., and is the second case of the congruence of triangles in the Elements.
Philo’s Proof.—Let the equal bases be applied as in the foregoing proof, but let the vertices
be on the opposite sides; then let BGC be the position which EDF takes. Join AG. Then
because BG = BA, the angle BAG = BGA. In like manner the angle CAG = CGA. Hence
the whole angle BAC = BGC; but BGC = EDF therefore BAC = EDF.
PROP. IX.—Problem.
To bisect a given rectilineal angle (BAC).
Sol.—In AB take any point D, and cut off
[iii.] AE equal to AD. Join DE (Post. i.), and
upon it, on the side remote from A, describe the
equilateral triangle DEF [i.] Join AF. AF bisects
the given angle BAC.
Dem.—The triangles DAF, EAF have the
side AD equal to AE (const.) and AF common;
therefore the two sides DA, AF are respectively
equal to EA, AF, and the base DF is equal to
the base EF, because they are the sides of an
equilateral triangle (Def. xxi.). Therefore [viii.]
the angle DAF is equal to the angle EAF; hence
the angle BAC is bisected by the line AF.
Cor.—The line AF is an axis of symmetry of the figure.

Questions for Examination.
1. Why does Euclid describe the equilateral triangle on the side remote from A?
2. In what case would the construction fail, if the equilateral triangle were described on
the other side of DE?
Exercises.
1. Prove this Proposition without using Prop. viii.
2. Prove that AF is perpendicular to DE.
3. Prove that any point in AF is equally distant from the points D and E.

PROP. X.—Problem.
To bisect a given finite right line (AB).
Sol.—Upon AB describe an equilateral triangle
ACB [i.]. Bisect the angle ACB by the line CD [ix.],
meeting AB in D, then AB is bisected in D.
Dem.—The two triangles ACD, BCD, have the
side AC equal to BC, being the sides of an equilateral
triangle, and CD common. Therefore the two sides
AC, CD in one are equal to the two sides BC, CD
in the other; and the angle ACD is equal to the angle
BCD (const.). Therefore the base AD is equal to the
base DB [iv.]. Hence AB is bisected in D.
Exercises.
1. Show how to bisect a finite right line by describing two circles.
2. Every point equally distant from the points A, B is in the line CD.
PROP. XI.—Problem.
From a given point (C) in
a given right line (AB) to draw
a right line perpendicular to the
given line.
Sol.—In AC take any point
D, and make CE equal to CD
[iii.]. Upon DE describe an equilateral triangle DF E [i.]. Join
CF. Then CF shall be at right angles to AB.
Dem.—The two triangles DCF, ECF have CD equal to CE (const.) and
CF common; therefore the two sides CD, CF in one are respectively equal
to the two sides CE, CF in the other, and the base DF is equal to the base
EF, being the sides of an equilateral triangle (Def. xxi.); therefore [viii.] the
angle DCE is equal to the angle ECF, and they are adjacent angles. Therefore
(Def. xiii.) each of them is a right angle, and CF is perpendicular to AB at the
point C.

PROP. XII.—Problem.
To draw a perpendicular to a given indefinite right line (AB) from a given
point (C) without it.
Sol.—Take any point D on the
other side of AB, and describe
(Post. iii.) a circle, with C as centre, and CD as radius, meeting AB
in the points F and G. Bisect F G
in H [x.]. Join CH (Post. i.). CH
shall be at right angles to AB.
Dem.—Join CF, CG. Then the
two triangles F HC, GHC have F H equal to GH (const.), and HC common; and the base CF equal to the base CG, being radii of the circle F DG
(Def. xxxii.). Therefore the angle CHF is equal to the angle CHG [viii.],
and, being adjacent angles, they are right angles (Def. xiii.). Therefore CH is
perpendicular to AB.
Exercises.
1. Prove that the circle cannot meet AB in more than two points.
2. If one angle of a triangle be equal to the sum of the other two, the triangle can be
divided into the sum of two isosceles triangles, and the base is equal to twice the line from its
middle point to the opposite angle.
PROP. XIII.—Theorem.
The adjacent angles (ABC, ABD) which one right line (AB) standing on
another (CD) makes with it are either both right angles, or their sum is equal
to two right angles.
17
Dem.—If AB is perpendicular to CD, as in fig. 1, the angles ABC, ABD
are right angles. If not, draw BE perpendicular to CD [xi.]. Now the angle
CBA is equal to the sum of the two angles CBE, EBA (Def. xi.). Hence,
adding the angle ABD, the sum of the angles CBA, ABD is equal to the sum
of the three angles CBE, EBA, ABD. In like manner, the sum of the angles
CBE, EBD is equal to the sum of the three angles CBE, EBA, ABD. And
things which are equal to the same are equal to one another. Therefore the sum
of the angles CBA, ABD is equal to the sum of the angles CBE, EBD; but
CBE, EBD are right angles; therefore the sum of the angles CBA, ABD is
two right angles.
Or thus: Denote the angle EBA by ?; then evidently
the angle CBA = right angle + ?;
the angle ABD = right angle ? ?;
therefore CBA + ABD = two right angles.
Cor. 1.—The sum of two supplemental angles is two right angles.
Cor. 2.—Two right lines cannot have a common segment.
Cor. 3.—The bisector of any angle bisects the corresponding re-entrant angle.
Cor. 4.—The bisectors of two supplemental angles are at right angles to each
other.
Cor. 5.—The angle EBA is half the difference of the angles CBA, ABD.
PROP. XIV.–Theorem.
If at a point (B) in a right line (BA) two
other right lines (CB, BD) on opposite sides
make the adjacent angles (CBA, ABD) together equal to two right angles, these two
right lines form one continuous line.
Dem.—If BD be not the continuation of
CB, let BE be its continuation. Now, since
CBE is a right line, and BA stands on it, the
sum of the angles CBA, ABE is two right
angles (xiii.); and the sum of the angles CBA, ABD is two right angles (hyp.);
18
therefore the sum of the angles CBA, ABE is equal to the sum of the angles
CBA, ABD. Reject the angle CBA, which is common, and we have the angle
ABE equal to the angle ABD—that is, a part equal to the whole—which is
absurd. Hence BD must be in the same right line with CB.
PROP. XV.—Theorem.
If two right lines (AB, CD) intersect one another, the opposite angles are
equal (CEA = DEB, and BEC = AED).
Dem.—Because the line AE stands on CD,
the sum of the angles CEA, AED is two right
angles [xiii.]; and because the line CE stands on
AB, the sum of the angles BEC, CEA is two
right angles; therefore the sum of the angles CEA,
AED is equal to the sum of the angles BEC,
CEA. Reject the angle CEA, which is common,
and we have the angle AED equal to BEC. In
like manner, the angle CEA is equal to DEB.
The foregoing proof may be briefly given, by saying that opposite angles are
equal because they have a common supplement.
Questions for Examination on Props. XIII., XIV., XV.
1. What problem is required in Euclid’s proof of Prop. xiii.?
2. What theorem? Ans. No theorem, only the axioms.

PROP. XVI.—Theorem.
If any side (BC) of a triangle (ABC) be produced, the exterior angle (ACD) is greater than either of the interior non-adjacent angles.
Dem.—Bisect AC in E [x.]. Join BE (Post. i.).
Produce it, and from the produced part cut off EF
equal to BE [iii]. Join CF. Now because EC is
equal to EA (const.), and EF is equal to EB, the
triangles CEF, AEB have the sides CE, EF in one
equal to the sides AE, EB in the other; and the
angle CEF equal to AEB [xv.]. Therefore [iv.] the
angle ECF is equal to EAB; but the angle ACD is greater than ECF; therefore
the angle ACD is greater than EAB.
19
In like manner it may be shown, if the side AC be produced, that the exterior
angle BCG is greater than the angle ABC; but BCG is equal to ACD [xv.].
Hence ACD is greater than ABC. Therefore ACD is greater than either of the
interior non-adjacent angles A or B of the triangle ABC.
Cor. 1.—The sum of the three interior angles of the triangle BCF is equal
to the sum of the three interior angles of the triangle ABC.
Cor. 2.—The area of BCF is equal to the area of ABC.
Cor. 3.—The lines BA and CF, if produced, cannot meet at any finite
distance. For, if they met at any finite point X, the triangle CAX would have
an exterior angle BAC equal to the interior angle ACX.
PROP. XVII.—Theorem.
Any two angles (B, C) of a triangle (ABC) are together less than two right
angles.
Dem.—Produce BC to D; then the exterior angle
ACD is greater than ABC [xvi.]: to each add the
angle ACB, and we have the sum of the angles ACD,
ACB greater than the sum of the angles ABC, ACB;
but the sum of the angles ACD, ACB is two right
angles [xiii.]. Therefore the sum of the angles ABC,
ACB is less than two right angles.
In like manner we may show that the sum of the angles A, B, or of the
angles A, C, is less than two right angles.
Cor. 1.—Every triangle must have at least two acute angles.
Cor. 2.—If two angles of a triangle be unequal, the lesser must be acute.
Exercise.
Prove Prop. xvii. without producing a side.
PROP. XVIII.—Theorem.
If in any triangle (ABC) one side (AC) be greater than another (AB), the
angle opposite to the greater side is grater than the angle opposite to the less.
Dem.—From AC cut off AD equal to AB
[iii]. Join BD (Post. i.). Now since AB is equal
to AD, the triangle ABD is isosceles; therefore [v.] the angle ADB is equal to ABD; but
the angle ADB is greater than the angle ACB
[xvi.]; therefore ABD is greater than ACB.
Much more is the angle ABC greater than the
angle ACB.
20
Or thus: From A as centre, with the lesser
side AB as radius, describe the circle BED,
cutting BC in E. Join AE. Now since AB is
equal to AE, the angle AEB is equal to ABE;
but AEB is greater than ACB (xvi.); therefore
ABE is greater than ACB.

2. This Proposition may be proved by producing the less side.
3. If two of the opposite sides of a quadrilateral be respectively the greatest and least, the
angles adjacent to the least are greater than their opposite angles.
4. In any triangle, the perpendicular from the vertex opposite the side which is not less
than either of the remaining sides falls within the triangle.
PROP. XIX.—Theorem.
If one angle (B) of a triangle (ABC) be greater than another angle (C), the
side (AC) which it opposite to the greater angle is greater than the side (AB)
which is opposite to the less.
Dem.—If AC be not greater than AB, it must
be either equal to it or less than it. Let us examine
each case:—
1. If AC were equal to AB, the triangle ACB
would be isosceles, and then the angle B would
be equal to C [v.]; but it is not by hypothesis;
therefore AB is not equal to AC.
2. If AC were less than AB, the angle B would
be less than the angle C [xviii.]; but it is not by hypothesis; therefore AC is
not less than AB; and since AC is neither equal to AB nor less than it, it must
be greater.
Exercises.
1. Prove this Proposition by a direct demonstration.
2. A line from the vertex of an isosceles triangle to any point in the base is less than either
of the equal sides, but greater if the point be in the base produced.
3. Three equal lines could not be drawn from the same point to the same line.
4. The perpendicular is the least line which can be drawn from a given point to a given
line; and of all others that may be drawn to it, that which is nearest to the perpendicular is
less than any one more remote.
5. If in the fig., Prop. xvi., AB be the greatest side of the 4 ABC, BF is the greatest
side of the 4 F BC, and the angle BF C is less than half the angle ABC.
6. If ABC be a 4 having AB not greater than AC, a line AG, drawn from A to any point
G in BC, is less than AC. For the angle ACB [xviii.] is not greater than ABC; but AGC
[xvi.] is greater than ABC; therefore AGC is greater than ACG. Hence AC is greater than
AG.
21
PROP. XX.—Theorem.
The sum of any two sides (BA, AC) of a triangle (ABC) is greater than the
third.
Dem.—Produce BA to D (Post. ii.),
and make AD equal to AC [iii.]. Join CD.
Then because AD is equal to AC, the angle
ACD is equal to ADC (v.); therefore the
angle BCD is greater than the angle BDC;
hence the side BD opposite to the greater
angle is greater than BC opposite to the
less [xix.]. Again, since AC is equal to AD,
adding BA to both, we have the sum of the
sides BA, AC equal to BD. Therefore the
sum of BA, AC is greater than BC.
Or thus: Bisect the angle BAC by AE [ix.] Then the angle BEA is greater than EAC;
but EAC = EAB (const.); therefore the angle BEA is greater than EAB. Hence AB is
greater than BE [xix.]. In like manner AC is greater than EC. Therefore the sum of BA,
AC is greater than BC.

2. If any point within a triangle be joined to its angular points, the sum of the joining
lines is greater than its semiperimeter.
3. If through the extremities of the base of a triangle, whose sides are unequal, lines

is called a median of the triangle.
9. The sum of the three medians of a triangle is less than its perimeter.
10. The sum of the diagonals of a quadrilateral is less than the sum of the lines which can
be drawn to its angular points from any point except the intersection of the diagonals.
PROP. XXI.—Theorem.
If two lines (BD, CD) be drawn to a point (D) within a triangle from the
extremities of its base (BC), their sum is less than the sum of the remaining
sides (BA, CA), but they contain a greater angle.
22
Dem.—1. Produce BD (Post. ii.) to meet
AC in E. Then, in the triangle BAE, the sum
of the sides BA, AE is greater than the side BE
[xx.]: to each add EC, and we have the sum
of BA, AC greater than the sum of BE, EC.
Again, the sum of the sides DE, EC of the triangle DEC is greater than DC: to each add BD,
and we get the sum of BE, EC greater than the
sum of BD, DC; but it has been proved that the sum of BA, AC is greater
than the sum of BE, EC. Therefore much more is the sum of BA, AC greater
than the sum of BD, DC.
2. The external angle BDC of the triangle DEC is greater than the internal
angle BEC [xvi.], and the angle BEC, for a like reason, is greater than BAC.
Therefore much more is BDC greater than BAC.
Part 2 may be proved without producing either of the sides BD, DC. Thus:
join AD and produce it to meet BC in F; then the angle BDF is greater than
the angle BAF [xvi.], and F DC is greater than F AC. Therefore the whole
angle BDC is greater than BAC.
Exercises.

PROP. XXII.—Problem.
To construct a triangle whose three sides shall be respectively equal to three
given lines (A, B, C), the sum of every two of which is greater than the third.
Sol.—Take any right line DE, terminated at D, but unlimited towards E,
and cut off [iii.] DF equal to A, F G equal to B, and GH equal to C. With F
as centre, and F D as radius, describe the circle KDL (Post. iii.); and with G
as centre, and GH as radius, describe the circle KHL, intersecting the former
circle in K. Join KF, KG. KF G is the triangle required.
23
Dem.—Since F is the centre of the circle KDL, FK is equal to F D; but
F D is equal to A (const.); therefore (Axiom i.) FK is equal to A. In like
manner GK is equal to C, and F G is equal to B (const.) Hence the three sides
of the triangle KF G are respectively equal to the three lines A, B, C.

order, shall be equal to those of DEF—namely, AB equal to ED, AC equal to
EF, and CB equal to F D; then the angle BAC will [viii.] be equal to DEF.
Hence it is the required angle.

PROP. XXIV.—Theorem.
If two triangles (ABC, DEF) have two sides (AB, AC) of one respectively
equal to two sides (DE, DF) of the other, but the contained angle (BAC) of
one greater than the contained angle (EDF) of the other, the base of that which
has the greater angle is greater than the base of the other.
Dem.—Of the two sides AB,
AC, let AB be the one which is not
the greater, and with it make the
angle BAG equal to EDF [xxiii.].
Then because AB is not greater
than AC, AG is less than AC [xix.,
Exer. 6]. Produce AG to H, and
make AH equal to DF or AC [iii.].
Join BH, CH.
In the triangles BAH, EDF, we
have AB equal to DE (hyp.), AH
equal to DF (const.), and the angle
BAH equal to the angle EDF (const.); therefore the base [iv.] BH is equal to
EF. Again, because AH is equal to AC (const.), the triangle ACH is isosceles;
therefore the angle ACH is equal to AHC [v.]; but ACH is greater than BCH;
therefore AHC is greater than BCH: much more is the angle BHC greater than
BCH, and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side [xix.]. Therefore
BC is greater than BH; but BH has been proved to be equal to EF; therefore
BC is greater than EF.
The concluding part of this Proposition may be proved without joining CH, thus:—
BG + GH > BH [xx.],
AG + GC > AC [xx.];
therefore BC + AH > BH + AC;
but AH = AC (const.);
therefore BC is > BH.
Or thus: Bisect the angle CAH by AO. Join OH. Now in the 4s CAO, HAO we have
the sides CA, AO in one equal to the sides AH, AO in the other, and the contained angles
equal; therefore the base OC is equal to the base OH [iv.]: to each add BO, and we have BC
equal to the sum of BO, OH; but the sum of BO, OH is greater than BH [xx.]. Therefore
BC is greater than BH, that is, greater than EF.

Exercises.
1. Prove this Proposition by making the angle ABH to the left of AB.
2. Prove that the angle BCA is greater than EF D.
PROP. XXV.—Theorem.
If two triangles (ABC, DEF) have two sides (AB, AC) of one respectively
equal to two sides (DE, DF) of the other, but the base (BC) of one greater
than the base (EF) of the other, the angle (A) contained by the sides of that
which has the greater base is greater them the angle (D) contained by the sides
of the other.
Dem.—If the angle A be not
greater than D, it must be either
equal to it or less than it. We
shall examine each case:—
1. If A were equal to D, the
triangles ABC, DEF would have
the two sides AB, AC of one respectively equal to the two sides
DE, DF of the other, and the angle A contained by the two sides
of one equal to the angle D contained by the two sides of the other. Hence [iv.]
BC would be equal to EF; but BC is, by hypothesis, greater than EF; hence
the angle A is not equal to the angle D.
2. If A were less than D, then D would be greater than A, and the triangles
DEF, ABC would have the two sides DE, DF of one respectively equal to the
two sides AB, AC of the other, and the angle D contained by the two sides of
one greater than the angle A contained by the two sides of the other. Hence
[xxiv.] EF would be greater than BC; but EF (hyp.) is not greater than BC.
Therefore A is not less than D, and we have proved that it is not equal to it;
therefore it must be greater.
Or thus, directly: Construct
the triangle ACG, whose three
sides AG, GC, CA shall be respectively equal to the three sides
DE, EF, F D of the triangle
DEF [xxii.]. Join BG. Then
because BC is greater than EF,
BC is greater than CG. Hence
[xviii.] the angle BGC is greater
than GBC; and make (xxiii.)
the angle BGH equal to GBH, and join AH. Then [vi.] BH is equal to
GH. Therefore the triangles ABH, AGH have the sides AB, AH of one equal
to the sides AG, AH of the other, and the base BH equal to GH. Therefore
[viii.] the angle BAH is equal to GAH. Hence the angle BAC is greater than
CAG, and therefore greater than EDF.
26
Exercise.
Demonstrate this Proposition directly by cutting off from BC a part equal to EF.
PROP. XXVI.—Theorem.
If two triangles (ABC, DEF) have two angles (B, C) of one equal respectively to two angles (E, F) of the other, and a side of one equal to a side
similarly placed with respect to the equal angles of the other, the triangles are
equal in every respect.
Dem.—This Proposition breaks up into two according as the sides given to
be equal are the sides adjacent to the equal angles, namely BC and EF, or
those opposite equal angles.
1. Let the equal sides be BC and EF;
then if DE be not equal to AB, suppose GE
to be equal to it. Join GF; then the triangles
ABC, GEF have the sides AB, BC of one
respectively equal to the sides GE, EF of the
other, and the angle ABC equal to the angle
GEF (hyp.); therefore [iv.] the angle ACB is
equal to the angle GF E; but the angle ACB
is (hyp.) equal to DF E; hence GF E is equal
to DF E—a part equal to the whole, which is absurd; therefore AB and DE are
not unequal, that is, they are equal. Consequently the triangles ABC, DEF
have the sides AB, BC of one respectively equal to the sides DE, EF of the
other; and the contained angles ABC and DEF equal; therefore [iv.] AC is
equal to DF, and the angle BAC is equal to the angle EDF.
2. Let the sides given to be equal be
AB and DE; it is required to prove that
BC is equal to EF, and AC to DF. If
BC be not equal to EF, suppose BG to
be equal to it. Join AG. Then the triangles ABG, DEF have the two sides AB,
BG of one respectively equal to the two
sides DE, EF of the other, and the angle
ABG equal to the angle DEF; therefore
[iv.] the angle AGB is equal to DF E; but the angle ACB is equal to DF E
(hyp.). Hence (Axiom i.) the angle AGB is equal to ACB, that is, the exterior
angle of the triangle ACG is equal to the interior and non-adjacent angle, which
[xvi.] is impossible. Hence BC must be equal to EF, and the same as in 1, AC
is equal to DF, and the angle BAC is equal to the angle EDF.
This Proposition, together with iv. and viii., includes all the cases of the congruence of
two triangles. Part I. may be proved immediately by superposition. For it is evident if ABC
be applied to DEF, so that the point B shall coincide with E, and the line BC with EF,
since BC is equal to EF, the point C shall coincide with F; and since the angles B, C are
27
respectively equal to the angles E, F, the lines BA, CA shall coincide with ED and F D.
Hence the triangles are congruent.
Def.—If every point on a geometrical figure satisfies an assigned condition,
that figure is called the locus of the point satisfying the condition. Thus, for
example, a circle is the locus of a point whose distance from the centre is equal
to its radius.
Exercises.

6. If two right-angled triangles have equal hypotenuses, and a side of one equal to a side

7. The bisectors of the three internal angles of a triangle are concurrent.
8. The bisectors of two external angles and the bisector of the third internal angle are

Parallel Lines.
Def. i.—If two right lines in the same plane be such that, when produced
indefinitely, they do not meet at any finite distance, they are said to be parallel.
Def. ii.—A parallelogram is a quadrilateral, both pairs of whose opposite
sides are parallel.
Def. iii.—The right line joining either pair of opposite angles of a quadrilateral is called a diagonal.
Def. iv.—If both pairs of opposite sides of a quadrilateral be produced to
meet, the right line joining their points of intersection is called its third diagonal.
Def. v.—A quadrilateral which has one pair of opposite sides parallel is
called a trapezium.
Def. vi.—If from the extremities of one right
line perpendiculars be drawn to another, the intercept between their feet is called the projection of the
first line on the second.
Def. vii.—When a right line intersects two
other right lines in two distinct points it makes
with them eight angles, which have received special names in relation to one another. Thus, in the
28
figure—1, 2; 7, 8 are called exterior angles; 3, 4; 5, 6, interior angles. Again,
4; 6; 3, 5 are called alternate angles; lastly, 1, 5; 2, 6; 3, 8; 4, 7 are called
corresponding angles.
PROP. XXVII.—Theorem.
If a right line (EF) intersecting two right lines (AB, CD) makes the alternate
angles (AEF, EF D) equal to each other, these lines are parallel.
Dem.—If AB and CD are not parallel they must meet, if produced, at some
finite distance: if possible let them meet
in G; then the figure EGF is a triangle,
and the angle AEF is an exterior angle,
and EF D a non-adjacent interior angle.
Hence [xvi.] AEF is greater than EF D;
but it is also equal to it (hyp.), that is, both equal and greater, which is absurd.
Hence AB and CD are parallel.
Or thus: Bisect EF in O; turn the whole figure round O as a centre, so that
EF shall fall on itself; then because OE = OF, the point E shall fall on F; and
because the angle AEF is equal to the angle EF D, the line EA will occupy
the place of F D, and the line F D the place of EA; therefore the lines AB, CD
interchange places, and the figure is symmetrical with respect to the point O.
Hence, if AB, CD meet on one side of O, they must also meet on the other
side; but two right lines cannot enclose a space (Axiom x.); therefore they do
not meet at either side. Hence they are parallel.
PROP. XXVIII.—Theorem.
If a right line (EF) intersecting two right lines (AB, CD) makes the exterior
angle (EGB) equal to its corresponding interior angle (GHD), or makes two
interior angles (BGH, GHD) on the same side equal to two right angles, the
two right lines are parallel.
Dem.—1. Since the lines AB, EF intersect, the angle AGH is equal to EGB [xv.];
but EGB is equal to GHD (hyp.); therefore
AGH is equal to GHD, and they are alternate
angles. Hence [xxvii.] AB is parallel to CD.
2. Since AGH and BGH are adjacent angles, their sum is equal to two right angles
[xiii.]; but the sum of BGH and GHD is two
right angles (hyp.); therefore rejecting the angle BGH we have AGH equal
GHD, and they are alternate angles; therefore AB is parallel to CD [xxvii.].
29
PROP. XXIX.—Theorem.
If a right line (EF) intersect two parallel right lines (AB, CD), it makes—
1. the alternate angles (AGH, GHD) equal to one another; 2. the exterior angle
(EGB) equal to the corresponding interior angle (GHD); 3. the two interior
angles (BGH, GHD) on the same side equal to two right angles.
Dem.—If the angle AGH be not equal to
GHD, one must be greater than the other. Let
AGH be the greater; to each add BGH, and
we have the sum of the angles AGH, BGH
greater than the sum of the angles BGH,
GHD; but the sum of AGH, BGH is two right
angles; therefore the sum of BGH, GHD is
less than two right angles, and therefore (Axiom xii.) the lines AB, CD, if produced, will meet at some finite distance: but
since they are parallel (hyp.) they cannot meet at any finite distance. Hence
the angle AGH is not unequal to GHD—that is, it is equal to it.
2. Since the angle EGB is equal to AGH [xv.], and GHD is equal to AGH
(1), EGB is equal to GHD (Axiom i.).
3. Since AGH is equal to GHD (1), add HGB to each, and we have the sum
of the angles AGH, HGB equal to the sum of the angles GHD, HGB; but the
sum of the angles AGH, HGB [xiii.] is two right angles; therefore the sum of
the angles BGH, GHD is two right angles.
Exercises.
1. Demonstrate both parts of Prop. xxviii. without using Prop. xxvii.
2. The parts of all perpendiculars to two parallel lines intercepted between them are equal.
3. If ACD, BCD be adjacent angles, any parallel to AB will meet the bisectors of these
angles in points equally distant from where it meets CD.
4. If through the middle point O of any right line terminated by two parallel right lines
any other secant be drawn, the intercept on this line made by the parallels is bisected in O.
5. Two right lines passing through a point equidistant from two parallels intercept equal
portions on the parallels.
6. The perimeter of the parallelogram, formed by drawing parallels to two sides of an
equilateral triangle from any point in the third side, is equal to twice the side.
7. If the opposite sides of a hexagon be equal and parallel, its diagonals are concurrent.
8. If two intersecting right lines be respectively parallel to two others, the angle between
the former is equal to the angle between the latter. For if AB, AC be respectively parallel to
DE, DF, and if AC, DE meet in G, the angles A, D are each equal to G [xxix.].
PROP. XXX.—Theorem.
If two right lines (AB, CD) be parallel to the same right line (EF), they are
parallel to one another.
30
Dem.—Draw any secant GHK. Then since
AB and EF are parallel, the angle AGH is equal
to GHF [xxix.]. In like manner the angle GHF
is equal to HKD [xxix.]. Therefore the angle
AGK is equal to the angle GKD (Axiom i.).
Hence [xxvii.] AB is parallel to CD.

that there are two solutions in each case.
6. Through two given points in two parallel lines draw two lines forming a lozenge with
the given parallels.
7. Between two lines given in position place a line of given length which shall be parallel
to a given line. Show that there are two solutions.
PROP. XXXII.—Theorem.
If any side (AB) of a triangle (ABC) be
produced (to D), the external angle (CBD)
is equal to the sum of the two internal nonadjacent angles (A, C), and the sum of the
three internal angles is equal to two right angles.
Dem.—Draw BE parallel to AC [xxxi.].
Now since BC intersects the parallels BE,
AC, the alternate angles EBC, ACB are
equal [xxix.]. Again, since AB intersects the parallels BE, AC, the angle
EBD is equal to BAC [xxix.]; hence the whole angle CBD is equal to the sum
31
of the two angles ACB, BAC: to each of these add the angle ABC and we
have the sum of CBD, ABC equal to the sum of the three angles ACB, BAC,
ABC: but the sum of CBD, ABC is two right angles [xiii.]; hence the sum of
the three angles ACB, BAC, ABC is two right angles.
Cor. 1.—If a right-angled triangle be isosceles, each base angle is half a right
angle.
Cor. 2.—If two triangles have two angles in one respectively equal to two

PROP. XXXIII.—Theorem.
The right lines (AC, BD) which join the adjacent extremities of two equal and
parallel right lines (AB, CD) are equal and parallel.
Dem.—Join BC. Now since AB is parallel to CD, and BC intersects them, the angle ABC is equal to the alternate angle DCB
[xxix.]. Again, since AB is equal to CD, and
BC common, the triangles ABC, DCB have
the sides AB, BC in one respectively equal to
the sides DC, CB in the other, and the angles
ABC, DCB contained by those sides equal;
therefore [iv.] the base AC is equal to the base
BD, and the angle ACB is equal to the angle CBD; but these are alternate
angles; hence [xxvii.] AC is parallel to BD, and it has been proved equal to it.
Therefore AC is both equal and parallel to BD.

DE, EF, the right line AC joining the extremities of the former pair is equal to the right line
DF joining the extremities of the latter.

lines bisect each other.
PROP. XXXIV.—Theorem.
The opposite sides (AB, CD; AC, BD) and the opposite angles (A, D;
B, C) of a parallelogram are equal to one another, and either diagonal bisects
the parallelogram.
Dem.—Join BC. Since AB is parallel to
CD, and BC intersects them, the angle ABC
is equal to the angle BCD [xxix.]. Again,
since BC intersects the parallels AC, BD, the
angle ACB is equal to the angle CBD; hence
the triangles ABC, DCB have the two angles
ABC, ACB in one respectively equal to the
two angles BCD, CBD in the other, and the
side BC common. Therefore [xxvi.] AB is equal to CD, and AC to BD; the
angle BAC to the angle BDC, and the triangle ABC to the triangle BDC.
Again, because the angle ACB is equal to CBD, and DCB equal to ABC,
the whole angle ACD is equal to the whole angle ABD.

PROP. XXXV.—Theorem.
Parallelograms on the same base (BC) and between the same parallels are
equal.
Dem.—1. Let the sides AD, DF
of the parallelograms AC, BF opposite to the common base BC terminate in the same point D, then
[xxxiv.] each parallelogram is double of the triangle BCD. Hence they
are equal to one another.
2. Let the sides AD, EF (figures
(?), (?)) opposite to BC not terminate in the same point.
34
Then because ABCD is a parallelogram, AD is equal to BC [xxxiv.]; and
since BCEF is a parallelogram, EF is equal to BC; therefore (see fig. (?))
take away ED, and in fig. (?) add ED, and we have in each case AE equal to
DF, and BA is equal to CD [xxxiv.]. Hence the triangles BAE, CDF have
the two sides BA, AE in one respectively equal to the two sides CD, DF in
the other, and the angle BAE [xxix.] equal to the angle CDF; hence [iv.] the
triangle BAE is equal to the triangle CDF; and taking each of these triangles
in succession from the quadrilateral BAF C, there will remain the parallelogram
BCF E equal to the parallelogram BCDA.
Or thus: The triangles ABE, DCF have [xxxiv.] the sides AB, BE in
one respectively equal to the sides DC, CF in the other, and the angle ABE
equal to the angle DCF [xxix., Ex. 8]. Hence the triangle ABE is equal to the
triangle DCF; and, taking each away from the quadrilateral BAF C, there will
remain the parallelogram BCF E equal to the parallelogram BCDA.
Observation.—By the second method of proof the subdivision of the demonstration into
cases is avoided. It is easy to see that either of the two parallelograms ABCD, EBCF can be
divided into parts and rearranged so as to make it congruent with the other. This Proposition
affords the first instance in the Elements in which equality which is not congruence occurs.
This equality is expressed algebraically by the symbol =, while congruence is denoted by ?,
called also the symbol of identity. Figures that are congruent are said to be identically equal.
PROP. XXXVI.—Theorem.
Parallelograms (BD, FH) on equal bases (BC, F G) and between the same
parallels are equal.
Dem.—Join BE, CH. Now
since F H is a parallelogram, F G
is equal to EH [xxxiv.]; but BC
is equal to F G (hyp.); therefore
BC is equal to EH (Axiom i.).
Hence BE, CH, which join their
adjacent extremities, are equal
and parallel; therefore BH is a
parallelogram. Again, since the parallelograms BD, BH are on the same base
BC, and between the same parallels BC, AH, they are equal [xxxv.]. In like
manner, since the parallelograms HB, HF are on the same base EH, and between the same parallels EH, BG, they are equal. Hence BD and F H are each
equal to BH. Therefore (Axiom i.) BD is equal to F H.
35
Exercise.—Prove this Proposition without joining BE, CH.
PROP. XXXVII.—Theorem.
Triangles (ABC, DBC) on the same base (BC) and between the same
parallels (AD, BC) are equal.
Dem.—Produce AD both
ways. Draw BE parallel to
AC, and CF parallel to BD
[xxxi.] Then the figures AEBC,
DBCF are parallelograms; and
since they are on the same base
BC, and between the same parallels BC, EF they are equal
[xxxv.]. Again, the triangle ABC is half the parallelogram AEBC [xxxiv.],
because the diagonal AB bisects it. In like manner the triangle DBC is half
the parallelogram DBCF, because the diagonal DC bisects it, and halves of
equal things are equal (Axiom vii.). Therefore the triangle ABC is equal to the
triangle DBC.
Exercises.
1. If two equal triangles be on the same base, but on opposite sides, the right line joining
their vertices is bisected by the base.
2. Construct a triangle equal in area to a given quadrilateral figure.

6. If through a point O, in the production of the diagonal AC of a parallelogram ABCD,
any right line be drawn cutting the sides AB, BC in the points E, F, and ED, F D be joined,
the triangle EF D is less than half the parallelogram.
PROP. XXXVIII.—Theorem.
Two triangles on equal bases and between the same parallels are equal.
Dem.—By a construction similar to the last, we see that the triangles are
the halves of parallelograms, on equal bases, and between the same parallels.
Hence they are the halves of equal parallelograms [xxxvi.]. Therefore they are
equal to one another.
Exercises.
1. Every median of a triangle bisects the triangle.
2. If two triangles have two sides of one respectively equal to two sides of the other, and
the contained angles supplemental, their areas are equal.
36
3. If the base of a triangle be divided into any number of equal parts, right lines drawn
from the vertex to the points of division will divide the whole triangle into as many equal
parts.
4. Right lines from any point in the diagonal of a parallelogram to the angular points
through which the diagonal does not pass, and the diagonal, divide the parallelogram into
four triangles which are equal, two by two.
5. If one diagonal of a quadrilateral bisects the other, it also bisects the quadrilateral, and
conversely.
6. If two 4s ABC, ABD be on the same base AB, and between the same parallels, and
if a parallel to AB meet the sides AC, BC in the point E, F; and the sides AD, BD in the
point G, H; then EF = GH.
7. If instead of triangles on the same base we have triangles on equal bases and between
the same parallels, the intercepts made by the sides of the triangles on any parallel to the
bases are equal.
8. If the middle points of any two sides of a triangle be joined, the triangle so formed with
the two half sides is one-fourth of the whole.
9. The triangle whose vertices are the middle points of two sides, and any point in the
base of another triangle, is one-fourth of that triangle.

bisects the parallelogram.
13. The triangle formed by joining the middle point of one of the non-parallel sides of a
trapezium to the extremities of the opposite side is equal to half the trapezium.
PROP. XXXIX.—Theorem.
Equal triangles (BAC, BDC) on the same base (BC) and on the same side of
it are between the same parallels.
Dem.—Join AD. Then if AD be not parallel to BC, let AE be parallel to it, and let
it cut BD in E. Join EC. Now since the triangles BEC, BAC are on the same base BC,
and between the same parallels BC, AE, they
are equal [xxxvii.]; but the triangle BAC is
equal to the triangle BDC (hyp.). Therefore
(Axiom i.) the triangle BEC is equal to the
triangle BDC—that is, a part equal to the whole which is absurd. Hence AD
must be parallel to BC.
PROP. XL.—Theorem.
Equal triangles (ABC, DEF) on equal bases (BC, EF) which form parts
of the same right line, and on the same side of the line, are between the same
parallels.
37
Dem.—Join AD. If AD be not
parallel to BF, let AG be parallel
to it. Join GF. Now since the triangles GEF and ABC are on equal
bases BC, EF, and between the same
parallels BF, AG, they are equal
[xxxviii.]; but the triangle DEF is
equal to the triangle ABC (hyp.). Hence GEF is equal to DEF (Axiom i.)—
that is, a part equal to the whole, which is absurd. Therefore AD must be
parallel to BF.
Def.—The altitude of a triangle is the perpendicular from the vertex on the
base.
Exercises.
1. Triangles and parallelograms of equal bases and altitudes are respectively equal.
2. The right line joining the middle points of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the
third; for the medians from the extremities of the base to these points will each bisect the
original triangle. Hence the two triangles whose base is the third side and whose vertices are
the points of bisection are equal.
3. The parallel to any side of a triangle through the middle point of another bisects the
third.
4. The lines of connexion of the middle points of the sides of a triangle divide it into four

PROP. XLI.—Theorem.
If a parallelogram (ABCD) and a triangle (EBC) be on the same base (BC)
and between the same parallels, the parallelogram is double of the triangle.
Dem.—Join AC. The parallelogram
ABCD is double of the triangle ABC [xxxiv.];
but the triangle ABC is equal to the triangle EBC [xxxvii.]. Therefore the parallelogram
ABCD is double of the triangle EBC.
Cor. 1.—If a triangle and a parallelogram
have equal altitudes, and if the base of the triangle be double of the base of the parallelogram,
the areas are equal.
38
Cor. 2.—The sum of the triangles whose bases are two opposite sides of
a parallelogram, and which have any point between these sides as a common
vertex, is equal to half the parallelogram.
PROP. XLII.—Problem.
To construct a parallelogram equal to a given triangle (ABC), and having an
angle equal to a given angle (D).
Sol.—Bisect AB in E. Join EC. Make the angle BEF [xxiii.] equal to D.
Draw CG parallel to AB [xxxi.], and BG parallel to EF. EG is a parallelogram
fulfilling the required conditions.
Dem.—Because AE is equal to EB (const.), the triangle AEC is equal
to the triangle EBC [xxxviii.], therefore the triangle ABC is double of the
triangle EBC; but the parallelogram EG is also double of the triangle EBC
[xli.], because they are on the same base EB, and between the same parallels
EB and CG. Therefore the parallelogram EG is equal to the triangle ABC,
and it has (const.) the angle BEF equal to D. Hence EG is a parallelogram
fulfilling the required conditions.
PROP. XLIII.—Theorem.
The parallels (EF, GH) through any
point (K) in one of the diagonals (AC) of
a parallelogram divide it into four parallelograms, of which the two (BK, KD) through
which the diagonal does not pass, and which
are called the complements of the other
two, are equal.
Dem.—Because the diagonal bisects the
parallelograms AC, AK, KC we have [xxxiv.] the triangle ADC equal to the
triangle ABC, the triangle AHK equal to AEK, and the triangle KF C equal
to the triangle KGC. Hence, subtracting the sums of the two last equalities
from the first, we get the parallelogram DK equal to the parallelogram KB.
Cor. 1.—If through a point K within a parallelogram ABCD lines drawn
parallel to the sides make the parallelograms DK, KB equal, K is a point in
the diagonal AC.
Cor. 2.—The parallelogram BH is equal to AF, and BF to HC.
Cor. 2. supplies an easy demonstration of a fundamental Proposition in Statics.
39
Exercises.
1. If EF, GH be parallels to the adjacent sides of a parallelogram ABCD, the diagonals EH, GF of two of the four s into
which they divide it and one of the diagonals
of ABCD are concurrent.
Dem.—Let EH, GF meet in M;
through M draw MP, MJ parallel to AB,
BC. Produce AD, GH, BC to meet MP,
and AB, EF, DC to meet MJ. Now the
complement OF = F J: to each add the
F L, and we get the figure OF L = CJ.
Again, the complement P H = HK [xliii.]:
to each add the OC, and we get the
P C = figure OF L. Hence the P C = CJ. Therefore they are about the same diagonal [xliii., Cor. 1]. Hence AC produced will pass through M.
2. The middle points of the three diagonals AC, BD, EF of a quadrilateral ABCD are
collinear.
Dem.—Complete the AEBG. Draw DH, CI parallel to AG, BG. Join IH, and
produce; then AB, CD, IH are concurrent (Ex. 1); therefore IH will pass through F. Join
EI, EH. Now [xi., Ex. 2, 3] the middle points of EI, EH, EF are collinear, but [xxxiv.,
Ex. 1] the middle points of EI, EH are the middle points of AC, BD. Hence the middle
points of AC, BD, EF are collinear.
PROP. XLIV.—Problem.
To a given, right line (AB) to apply a parallelogram which shall be equal to
a given triangle (C), and have one of its angles equal to a given angle (D).
40
Sol.—Construct the parallelogram BEF G [xlii.] equal to the given triangle
C, and having the angle B equal to the given angle D, and so that its side BE
shall be in the same right line with AB. Through A draw AH parallel to BG
[xxxi.], and produce F G to meet it in H. Join HB. Then because HA and F E
are parallels, and HF intersects them, the sum of the angles AHF, HF E is two
right angles [xxix.]; therefore the sum of the angles BHF, HF E is less than
two right angles; and therefore (Axiom xii.) the lines HB, F E, if produced,
will meet as at K. Through K draw KL parallel to AB [xxxi.], and produce
HA and GB to meet it in the points L and M. Then AM is a parallelogram
fulfilling the required conditions.
Dem.—The parallelogram AM is equal to GE [xliii.]; but GE is equal to
the triangle C (const.); therefore AM is equal to the triangle C. Again, the
angle ABM is equal to EBG [xv.], and EBG is equal to D (const.); therefore
the angle ABM is equal to D; and AM is constructed on the given line; therefore
it is the parallelogram required.
PROP. XLV.—Problem.
To construct a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure (ABCD), and
having an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle (X).
Sol.—Join BD. Construct a parallelogram EG [xlii.] equal to the triangle
ABD, and having the angle E equal to the given angle X; and to the right line
GH apply the parallelogram HI equal to the triangle BCD, and having the
angle GHK equal to X [xliv.], and so on for additional triangles if there be
any. Then EI is a parallelogram fulfilling the required conditions.
41
Dem.—Because the angles GHK, F EH are each equal to X (const.), they
are equal to one another: to each add the angle GHE, and we have the sum
of the angles GHK, GHE equal to the sum of the angles F EH, GHE; but
since HG is parallel to EF, and EH intersects them, the sum of F EH, GHE
is two right angles [xxix.]. Hence the sum of GHK, GHE is two right angles;
therefore EH, HK are in the same right line [xiv.].
Again, because GH intersects the parallels F G, EK, the alternate angles
F GH, GHK are equal [xxix.]: to each add the angle HGI, and we have the
sum of the angles F GH, HGI equal to the sum of the angles GHK, HGI; but
since GI is parallel to HK, and GH intersects them, the sum of the angles
GHK, HGI is equal to two right angles [xxix.]. Hence the sum of the angles
F GH, HGI is two right angles; therefore F G and GI are in the same right line
[xiv.].
Again, because EG and HI are parallelograms, EF and KI are each parallel
to GH; hence [xxx.] EF is parallel to KI, and the opposite sides EK and F I
are parallel; therefore EI is a parallelogram; and because the parallelogram EG
(const.) is equal to the triangle ABD, and HI to the triangle BCD, the whole
parallelogram EI is equal to the rectilineal figure ABCD, and it has the angle
E equal to the given angle X. Hence EI is a parallelogram fulfilling the required
conditions.
It would simplify Problems xliv., xlv., if they were stated as the constructing of rectangles, and in this special form they would be better understood by the student, since rectangles
are the simplest areas to which others are referred.
Exercises.
1. Construct a rectangle equal to the sum of two or any number of rectilineal figures.
2. Construct a rectangle equal to the difference of two given figures.
PROP. XLVI.—Problem.
On a given right line (AB) to describe a square.
Sol.—Erect AD at right angles to AB [xi.], and make
it equal to AB [iii.]. Through D draw DC parallel to AB
[xxxi.], and through B draw BC parallel to AD; then
AC is the square required.
Dem.—Because AC is a parallelogram, AB is equal
to CD [xxxiv.]; but AB is equal to AD (const.); therefore AD is equal to CD, and AD is equal to BC [xxxiv.].
Hence the four sides are equal; therefore AC is a lozenge,
and the angle A is a right angle. Therefore AC is a
square (Def. xxx.).
42
Exercises.
1. The squares on equal lines are equal; and, conversely, the sides of equal squares are
equal.
2. The parallelograms about the diagonal of a square are squares.
3. If on the four sides of a square, or on the sides produced, points be taken equidistant
from the four angles, they will be the angular points of another square, and similarly for a
regular pentagon, hexagon, &c.
4. Divide a given square into five equal parts; namely, four right-angled triangles, and a
square.
PROP. XLVII.—Theorem.
In a right-angled triangle (ABC) the square on the hypotenuse (AB) is equal
to the sum of the squares on the other two sides (AC, BC).
Dem.—On the sides AB, BC,
CA describe squares [xlvi.]. Draw
CL parallel to AG. Join CG, BK.
Then because the angle ACB is right
(hyp.), and ACH is right, being the
angle of a square, the sum of the angles ACB, ACH is two right angles;
therefore BC, CH are in the same
right line [xiv.]. In like manner AC,
CD are in the same right line. Again,
because BAG is the angle of a square
it is a right angle: in like manner
CAK is a right angle. Hence BAG
is equal to CAK: to each add BAC,
and we get the angle CAG equal to
KAB. Again, since BG and CK are squares, BA is equal to AG, and CA to
AK. Hence the two triangles CAG, KAB have the sides CA, AG in one respectively equal to the sides KA, AB in the other, and the contained angles CAG,
KAB also equal. Therefore [iv.] the triangles are equal; but the parallelogram
AL is double of the triangle CAG [xli.], because they are on the same base AG,
and between the same parallels AG and CL. In like manner the parallelogram
AH is double of the triangle KAB, because they are on the same base AK, and
between the same parallels AK and BH; and since doubles of equal things are
equal (Axiom vi.), the parallelogram AL is equal to AH. In like manner it can
be proved that the parallelogram BL is equal to BD. Hence the whole square
AF is equal to the sum of the two squares AH and BD.
43
Or thus: Let all the squares be made in reversed directions. Join CG, BK, and through C draw OL parallel
to AG. Now, taking the ?BAC from the right ?s BAG,
CAK, the remaining ?s CAG, BAK are equal. Hence the
4s CAG, BAK have the side CA = AK, and AG = AB,
and the ?CAG = BAK; therefore [iv.] they are equal; and
since [xli.] the s AL, AH are respectively the doubles of
these triangles, they are equal. In like manner the s BL,
BD are equal; hence the whole square AF is equal to the
sum of the two squares AH, BD.
This proof is shorter than the usual one, since it is not
necessary to prove that AC, CD are in one right line. In a
similar way the Proposition may be proved by taking any of
the eight figures formed by turning the squares in all possible
directions. Another simplification of the proof would be got
by considering that the point A is such that one of the 4s CAG, BAK can be turned round
it in its own plane until it coincides with the other; and hence that they are congruent.

.
8. The square described on the sum of the sides of a right-angled triangle exceeds the
square on the hypotenuse by four times the area of the triangle (see fig., xlvi., Ex. 3). More
generally, if the vertical angle of a triangle be equal to the angle of a regular polygon of n
sides, then the regular polygon of n sides, described on a line equal to the sum of its sides,
exceeds the area of the regular polygon of n sides described on the base by n times the area
of the triangle.
9. If AC and BK intersect in P, and through P a line be drawn parallel to BC, meeting

square on the perpendicular to it from the opposite vertex.
15. On BE, a part of the side BC of a square ABCD, is described the square BEF G,
having its side BG in the continuation of AB; it is required to divide the figure AGF ECD
into three parts which will form a square.
16. Four times the sum of the squares on the medians which bisect the sides of a rightangled triangle is equal to five times the square on the hypotenuse.
17. If perpendiculars be let fall on the sides of a polygon from any point, dividing each
side into two segments, the sum of the squares on one set of alternate segments is equal to
the sum of the squares on the remaining set.
18. The sum of the squares on lines drawn from any point to one pair of opposite angles

sides; prove that the sum of the rectangles contained by the sides and their lower segments is

PROP. XLVIII.—Theorem.
If the square on one side (AB) of a triangle be equal to the sum of the squares
on the remaining sides (AC, CB), the angle (C) opposite to that side is a right
angle.
Dem.—Erect CD at right angles to CB [xi.], and
make CD equal to CA [iii.]. Join BD. Then because
AC is equal to CD, the square on AC is equal to the
square on CD: to each add the square on CB, and
we have the sum of the squares on AC, CB equal
to the sum of the squares on CD, CB; but the sum
of the squares on AC, CB is equal to the square on
AB (hyp.), and the sum of the squares on CD, CB
is equal to the square on BD [xlvii.]. Therefore the
square on AB is equal to the square on BD. Hence AB is equal to BD [xlvi.,
Ex. 1]. Again, because AC is equal to CD (const.), and CB common to the
two triangles ACB, DCB, and the base AB equal to the base DB, the angle
ACB is equal to the angle DCB; but the angle DCB is a right angle (const.).
Hence the angle ACB is a right angle.
The foregoing proof forms an exception to Euclid’s
demonstrations of converse propositions, for it is direct.
The following is an indirect proof:—If CB be not at right
angles to AC, let CD be perpendicular to it. Make CD =
CB. Join AD. Then, as before, it can be proved that AD
is equal to AB, and CD is equal to CB (const.). This is
contrary to Prop. vii. Hence the angle ACB is a right
angle.

BOOK II.
THEORY OF RECTANGLES
Every Proposition in the Second Book has either a square or a rectangle in
its enunciation. Before commencing it the student should read the following
preliminary explanations: by their assistance it will be seen that this Book,
which is usually considered difficult, will be rendered not only easy, but almost
intuitively evident.
1. As the linear unit is that by which we express all linear measures, so the square unit is
that to which all superficial measures are referred. Again, as there are different linear units
in use, such as in this country, inches, feet, yards, miles, &c., and in France, metres, and their
multiples or sub-multiples, so different square units are employed.
2. A square unit is the square described on a line whose length is the linear unit. Thus
a square inch is the square described on a line whose length is an inch; a square foot is the
square described on a line whose length is a foot, &c.
3. If we take a linear foot, describe a square on it, divide two adjacent sides each into
twelve equal parts, and draw parallels to the sides, we evidently divide the square foot into
square inches; and as there will manifestly be 12 rectangular parallelograms, each containing
12 square inches, the square foot contains 144 square inches.
In the same manner it can be shown that a square yard contains 9 square feet; and so in
general the square described on any line contains n
2
times the square described on the n
th
part of the line. Thus, as a simple case, the square on a line is four times the square on its
half. On account of this property the second power of a quantity is called its square; and,
conversely, the square on a line AB is expressed symbolically by AB2
.
4. If a rectangular parallelogram be such that two adjacent sides contain respectively m
and n linear units, by dividing one side into m and the other into n equal parts, and drawing
parallels to the sides, the whole area is evidently divided into mn square units. Hence the area
of the parallelogram is found by multiplying its length by its breadth, and this explains why
we say (see Def. iv.) a rectangle is contained by any two adjacent sides; for if we multiply the
length of one by the length of the other we have the area. Thus, if AB, AD be two adjacent
sides of a rectangle, the rectangle is expressed by AB . AD.
Definitions.
i. If a point C be taken in a line AB, the
parts AC, CB are called segments, and C a point
of division.
ii. If C be taken in the line AB produced,
AC, CB are still called the segments of the
line AB; but C is called a point of external division.
iii. A parallelogram whose angles are right angles is called a rectangle.
iv. A rectangle is said to be contained by
any two adjacent sides. Thus the rectangle
ABCD is said to be contained by AB, AD, or
by AB, BC, &c.
v. The rectangle contained by two separate lines such as AB and CD is the parallelogram formed by erecting a perpendicular to
49
AB, at A, equal to CD, and drawing parallels:
the area of the rectangle will be AB . CD.
vi. In any parallelogram the figure which
is composed of either of the parallelograms
about a diagonal and the two complements
[see I., xliii.] is called a gnomon. Thus, if we
take away either of the parallelograms AO,
OC from the parallelogram AC, the remainder is called a gnomon.
PROP. I.—Theorem.
If there be two lines (A, BC), one of which is divided into any number of
parts (BD, DE, EC), the rectangle contained by the two lines (A, BC), is
equal to the sum of the rectangles contained by the undivided line (A) and the
several parts of the divided line.
Dem.—Erect BF at right angles to BC [I., xi.] and make it
equal to A. Complete the parallelogram BK (Def. v.). Through D,
E draw DG, EH parallel to BF.
Because the angles at B, D, E are
right angles, each of the quadrilaterals BG, DH, EK is a rectangle.
Again, since A is equal to BF (const.), the rectangle contained by A and BC
is the rectangle contained by BF and BC (Def. v.); but BK is the rectangle
contained by BF and BC. Hence the rectangle contained by A and BC is BK.
In like manner the rectangle contained by A and BD is BG. Again, since A is
equal to BF (const.), and BF is equal to DG [I. xxxiv.], A is equal to DG.
Hence the rectangle contained by A and DE is the figure DH (Def. v.). In like
manner the rectangle contained by A and EC is the figure EK. Hence we have
the following identities:—
Rectangle contained by A and BD ? BG.
,, ,, A ,, DE ? DH.
,, ,, A ,, EC ? EK.
,, ,, A ,, BC ? BK.
But BK is equal to the sum of BG, DH, EK (I., Axiom ix.). Therefore the
rectangle contained by A and BC is equal to the sum of the rectangles contained
by A and BD, A and DE, A and EC.
If we denote the lines BD, DE, EC by a, b, c, the Proposition asserts that the rectangle
contained by A, and a + b + c is equal to the sum of the rectangles contained by A and a, A
50
and b, A and c, or, as it may be written, A(a + b + c) = Aa + Ab + Ac. This corresponds to
the distributive law in multiplication, and shows that rectangles in Geometry, and products
in Arithmetic and Algebra, are subject to the same rules.
Illustration.—Suppose A to be 6 inches; BD, 5 inches; DE, 4 inches; EC, 3 inches; then
BC will be 12 inches; and the rectangles will have the following values:—
Rectangle A . BC = 6 × 12 = 72 square inches.
,, A . BD = 6 × 5 = 30 ,,
,, A . DE = 6 × 4 = 24 ,,
,, A . EC = 6 × 3 = 18 ,,
Now the sum of the three last rectangles, viz. 30, 24, 18, is 72. Hence the rectangle
A . BC = A . BD + A . DE + A . EC.
The Second Book is occupied with the relations between the segments of a
line divided in various ways. All these can be proved in the most simple manner by Algebraic Multiplication. We recommend the student to make himself
acquainted with the proofs by this method as well as with those of Euclid. He
will thus better understand the meaning of each Proposition.
Cor. 1.—The rectangle contained by a line and the difference of two others
is equal to the difference of the rectangles contained by the line and each of the
others.
Cor. 2.—The area of a triangle is equal to half the rectangle contained by its
base and perpendicular.
Dem.—From the vertex C let fall the perpendicular CD. Draw EF parallel to AB, and
AE, BF each parallel to CD. Then AF is the
rectangle contained by AB and BF; but BF is
equal to CD. Hence AF = AB . CD; but [I. xli.]
the triangle ABC is = half the parallelogram AF.
Therefore the triangle ABC is =
1
2AB . CD.
PROP. II.—Theorem.
If a line (AB) be divided into any two parts (at C), the square on the whole
line is equal to the sum of the rectangles contained by the whole and each of the
segments (AC, CB).
Dem.—On AB describe the square ABDF
[I. xlvi.], and through C draw CE parallel to AF
[I. xxxi.]. Now, since AB is equal to AF, the rectangle contained by AB and AC is equal to the rectangle
contained by AF and AC; but AE is the rectangle
contained by AF and AC. Hence the rectangle contained by AB and AC is equal to AE. In like manner
the rectangle contained by AB and CB is equal to the
figure CD. Therefore the sum of the two rectangles
AB . AC, AB . CB is equal to the square on AB.
Or thus: AB = AC + CB,
and AB = AB.
Hence, multiplying, we get AB2 = AB . AC + AB . CB.
51
This Proposition is the particular case of i. when the divided and undivided lines are
equal, hence it does not require a separate Demonstration.
PROP. III.—Theorem.
If a line (AB) be divided into two segments (at C), the rectangle contained
by the whole line and either segment (CB) is equal to the square on that segment
together with the rectangle contained by the segments.
Dem.—On BC describe the square BCDE
[I. xlvi.]. Through A draw AF parallel to CD:
produce ED to meet AF in F. Now since CB
is equal to CD, the rectangle contained by AC,
CB is equal to the rectangle contained by AC,
CD; but the rectangle contained by AC, CD is
the figure AD. Hence the rectangle AC . CB is equal to the figure AD, and the
square on CB is the figure CE. Hence the rectangle AC . CB, together with
the square on CB, is equal to the figure AE.
Again, since CB is equal to BE, the rectangle AB . CB is equal to the
rectangle AB . BE; but the rectangle AB . BE is equal to the figure AE. Hence
the rectangle AB . CB is equal to the figure AE. And since things which are
equal to the same are equal to one another, the rectangle AC . CB, together with
the square on CB, is equal to the rectangle AB . CB.
Or thus: AB = AC + CB,
CB = CB.
Hence AB . CB = AC . CB + CB2
.
Prop. iii. is the particular case of Prop. i., when the undivided line is equal to a segment
of the divided line.
PROP. IV.—Theorem.
If a line (AB) be divided into any two parts (at C), the square on the whole
line is equal to the sum of the squares on the parts (AC, CB), together with
twice their rectangle.
Dem.—On AB describe a square ABDE. Join
EB; through C draw CF parallel to AE, intersecting
BE in G; and through G draw HI parallel to AB.
Now since AE is equal to AB, the angle ABE
is equal to AEB [I. v.]; but since BE intersects the
parallels AE, CF, the angle AEB is equal to CGB
[I. xxix.]. Hence the angle CBG is equal to CGB,
and therefore [I. vi.] CG is equal to CB; but CG is
equal to BI and CB to GI. Hence the figure CBIG
is a lozenge, and the angle CBI is right. Hence (I., Def. xxx.) it is a square.
In like manner the figure EF GH is a square.
52
Again, since CB is equal to CG, the rectangle AC . CB is equal to the
rectangle AC . CG; but AC . CG is the figure AG (Def. iv.). Therefore the
rectangle AC . CB is equal to the figure AG. Now the figures AG, GD are
equal [I. xliii.], being the complements about the diagonal of the parallelogram
AD. Hence the parallelograms AG, GD are together equal to twice the rectangle
AC . CB. Again, the figure HF is the square on HG, and HG is equal to AC.
Therefore HF is equal to the square on AC, and CI is the square on CB; but
the whole figure AD, which is the square on AB, is the sum of the four figures
HF, CI, AG, GD. Therefore the square on AB is equal to the sum of the
squares on AC, CB, and twice the rectangle AC . CB.
Or thus: On AB describe the square ABDE, and cut off
AH, EG, DF each equal to CB. Join CF, F G, GH, HC. Now
the four 4s ACH, CBF, F DG, GEH are evidently equal;
therefore their sum is equal to four times the 4ACH; but the
4ACH is half the rectangle AC . AH (i. Cor. 2)—that is, equal
to half the rectangle AC . CB. Therefore the sum of the four
triangles is equal to 2AC . CB.
Again, the figure CF GH is a square [I. xlvi., Cor. 3], and
equal to AC2 + AH2
[I. xlvii.]—that is, equal to AC2 + CB2
.
Hence the whole figure ABDE = AC2 + CB2 + 2AC . CB.
Or thus: AB = AC + CB.
Squaring, we get AB2 =AC2 + 2AC . CB + CB2
.
Cor. 1.—The parallelograms about the diagonal of a square are squares.
Cor. 2.—The square on a line is equal to four
times the square on its half.
For let AB = 2AC, then AB2 = 4AC2
.
This Cor. may be proved by the First Book
thus: Erect CD at right angles to AB, and make
CD = AC or CB. Join AD, DB.
Then AD2 = AC2 + CD2 = 2AC2
In like manner, DB2 = 2CB2
;
therefore AD2 + DB2 = 2AC2 + 2CB2 = 4AC2
.
But since the angle ADB is right, AD2 + DB2 = AB2
;
therefore AB2 = 4AC2
.
Cor. 3.—If a line be divided into any number of parts, the square on the
whole is equal to the sum of the squares on all the parts, together with twice the
sum of the rectangles contained by the several distinct pairs of parts.
53
Exercises.

2. If from the vertical angle of a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be let fall on the
hypotenuse, its square is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the hypotenuse.
3. From the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle portions are cut off equal to the adjacent
sides; prove that the square on the middle segment is equal to twice the rectangle contained
by the extreme segments.
4. In any right-angled triangle the square on the sum of the hypotenuse and perpendicular,
from the right angle on the hypotenuse, exceeds the square on the sum of the sides by the
square on the perpendicular.
5. The square on the perimeter of a right-angled triangle is equal to twice the rectangle
contained by the sum of the hypotenuse and one side, and the sum of the hypotenuse and the
other side.
PROP. V.—Theorem.
If a line (AB) be divided into two equal parts (at C), and also into two
unequal parts (at D), the rectangle (AD . DB) contained by the unequal parts,
together with the square on the part (CD) between the points of section, is equal
to the square on half the line.
Dem.—On CB describe the square
CBEF [I. xlvi.]. Join BF. Through D
draw DG parallel to CF, meeting BF in
H. Through H draw KM parallel to AB,
and through A draw AK parallel to CL
[I. xxxi.].
The parallelogram CM is equal to DE
[I. xliii., Cor. 2]; but AL is equal to CM [I. xxxvi.], because they are on equal
bases AC, CB, and between the same parallels; therefore AL is equal to DE:
to each add CH, and we get the parallelogram AH equal to the gnomon CMG;
but AH is equal to the rectangle AD . DH, and therefore equal to the rectangle
AD . DB, since DH is equal to DB [iv., Cor. 1]; therefore the rectangle AD . DB
is equal to the gnomon CMG, and the square on CD is equal to the figure LG.
Hence the rectangle AD . DB, together with the square on CD, is equal to the
whole figure CBEF—that is, to the square on CB.
Or thus: AD = AC + CD = BC + CD;
DB = BC ? CD;
therefore AD . BD = (BC + CD)(BC ? CD) = BC2 ? CD2
.
Hence AD . BD + CD2 = BC2
.
Cor. 1.—The rectangle AD . DB is the rectangle contained by the sum of the
lines AC, CD and their difference; and we have proved it equal to the difference
between the square on AC and the square on CD. Hence the difference of the
54
squares on two lines is equal to the rectangle contained by their sum and their
difference.
Cor. 2.—The perimeter of the rectangle AH is equal to 2AB, and is therefore
independent of the position of the point D on the line AB; and the area of the
same rectangle is less than the square on half the line by the square on the
segment between D and the middle point of the line; therefore, when D is the
middle point, the rectangle will have the maximum area. Hence, of all rectangles
having the same perimeter, the square has the greatest area.
Exercises.
1. Divide a given line so that the rectangle contained by its parts may have a maximum
area.
2. Divide a given line so that the rectangle contained by its segments may be equal to a

5. The difference between the square on one of the equal sides of an isosceles triangle, and

contained by the segments of the base.
6. The square on either side of a right-angled triangle is equal to the rectangle contained
by the sum and the difference of the hypotenuse and the other side.
PROP. VI.—Theorem.
If a line (AB) be bisected (at C), and divided externally in any point (D),
the rectangle (AD . BD) contained by the segments made by the external point,
together with the square on half the line, is equal to the square on the segment
between the middle point and the point of external division.
Dem.—On CD describe the square
CDF E [I. xlvi.], and join DE; through
B draw BHG parallel to CE [I. xxxi.],
meeting DE in H; through H draw KLM
parallel to AD; and through A draw AK
parallel to CL. Then because AC is equal
to CB, the rectangle AL is equal to CH
[I. xxxvi.]; but the complements CH, HF
are equal [I. xliii.]; therefore AL is equal
to HF. To each of these equals add CM and LG, and we get AM and LG
equal to the square CDF E; but AM is equal to the rectangle AD . DM, and
therefore equal to the rectangle AD . DB, since DB is equal to DM; also LG
is equal to the square on CB, and CDF E is the square on CD. Hence the
rectangle AD . DB, together with the square on CB, it equal to the square on
CD.
55
Or thus:—
Dem.—On CB describe the square
CBEF [I. xlvi.]. Join BF. Through D
draw DG parallel to CF, meeting F B produced in H. Through H draw KM parallel
to AB. Through A draw AK parallel A to
CL [I. xxxi.].
The parallelogram CM is equal to DE
[I. xliii.]; but AL is equal to CM [I. xxxvi.],
because they are on equal bases AC, CB, and
between the same parallels; therefore AL is equal to DE. To each add CH, and
we get the parallelogram AH equal to the gnomon CMG; but AH is equal
to the rectangle AD . DH, and therefore equal to the rectangle AD . DB, since
DH is equal to DB [iv., Cor. 1]; therefore the rectangle AD . DB is equal to
the gnomon CMG, and the square on CB is the figure CE. Therefore the
rectangle AD . DB, together with the square on CB, is equal to the whole figure
LHGF—that is, equal to the square on LH or to the square on CD.
Or thus: AD = AC + CD = CD + CB;
BD = CD ? CB.
Hence AD . DB = (CD + CB)(CD ? CB) = CD2 ? CB2
;
therefore AD . DB + CB2 = CD2
.

PROP. VII.—Theorem.
If a right line (AB) be divided into any two parts (at C), the sum of the
squares on the whole line (AB) and either segment (CB) is equal to twice the
rectangle (2AB . CB) contained by the whole line and that segment, together
with the square on the other segment.
56
Dem.—On AB describe the square ABDE. Join
BE. Through C draw CG parallel to AE, intersecting
BE in F. Through F draw HK parallel to AB.
Now the square AD is equal to the three figures AK,
F D, and GH: to each add the square CK, and we have
the sum of the squares AD, CK equal to the sum of the
three figures AK, CD, GH; but CD is equal to AK;
therefore the sum of the squares AD, CK is equal to
twice the figure AK, together with the figure GH. Now AK is the rectangle
AB . BK; but BK is equal to BC; therefore AK is equal to the rectangle
AB . BC, and AD is the square on AB; CK the square on CB; and GH is the
square on HF, and therefore equal to the square on AC. Hence the sum of the
squares on AB and BC is equal to twice the rectangle AB . BC, together with
the square on AC.
Or thus: On AC describe the square ACDE. Produce
the sides CD, DE, EA, and make each produced part
equal to CB. Join BF, F G, GH, HB. Then the figure
BF GH is a square [I. xlvi., Ex. 3], and it is equal to the
square on AC, together with the four equal triangles HAB,
BCF, F DG, GEH. Now [I. xlvii.], the figure BF GH is
equal to the sum of the squares on AB, AH—that is, equal
to the sum of the squares on AB, BC; and the sum of the
four triangles is equal to twice the rectangle AB . BC, for
each triangle is equal to half the rectangle AB . BC. Hence
the sum of the squares on AB, BC is equal to twice the
rectangle AB . BC, together with the square on AC.
Or thus: AC = AB ? BC;
therefore AC2 = AB2 ? 2AB . BC + BC2
;
therefore AC2 + 2AB . BC = AB2 + BC2
.
Comparison of iv. and vii.
By iv., square on sum = sum of squares + twice rectangle.
By vii., square on difference = sum of squares-twice rectangle.
Cors. from iv. and vii.
1. Square on the sum, the sum of the squares, and the square on the difference
of any two lines, are in arithmetical progression.
2. Square on the sum + square on the difference of any two lines = twice
the sum of the squares on the lines (Props. ix. and x.).
3. The square on the sum ? the square on the difference of any two lines =
four times the rectangle under lines (Prop. viii.).
PROP. VIII.–Theorem.
If a line (AB) be divided into two parts (at C), the square on the sum of the
whole line (AB) and either segment (BC) is equal to four times the rectangle
contained by the whole line (AB) and that segment, together with the square on
the other segment (AC).

Dem.—Produce AB to D. Make BD equal to
BC. On AD describe the square AEF D [I. xlvi.].
Join DE. Through C, B draw CH, BL parallel to
AE [I. xxxi.], and through K, I draw MN, P O
parallel to AD.
Since CO is the square on CD, and CK the
square on CB, and CB is the half of CD, CO is
equal to four times CK [iv., Cor. 1]. Again, since
CG, GI are the sides of equal squares, they are equal [I. xlvi., Cor. 1]. Hence
the parallelogram AG is equal to MI [I. xxxvi.]. In like manner IL is equal
to JF; but MI is equal to IL [I. xliii.]. Therefore the four figures AG, MI,
IL, JF are all equal; hence their sum is equal to four times AG; and the square
CO has been proved to be equal to four times CK. Hence the gnomon AOH is
equal to four times the rectangle AK—that is, equal to four times the rectangle
AB . BC, since BC is equal to BK.
Again, the figure P H is the square on P I, and therefore equal to the square
on AC. Hence the whole figure AF, that is, the square on AD, is equal to four
times the rectangle AB . BC, together with the square on AC.
Or thus: Produce BA to D, and make AD = BC. On DB
describe the square DBEF. Cut off BG, EI, F L each equal to
BC. Through A and I draw lines parallel to DF, and through
G and L, lines parallel to AB.
Now it is evident that the four rectangles. AG, GI, IL,
LA are all equal; but AG is the rectangle AB . BG or AB . BC.
Therefore the sum of the four rectangles is equal to 4AB . BC.
Again, the figure NP is evidently equal to the square on AC.
Hence the whole figure, which is the square on BD, or the
square on the sum of AB and BC, is equal to 4AB . BC + AC2
.
Or thus: AB + BC = AC + 2BC;
therefore (AB + BC)
2 = AC2 + 4AC . CB + 4BC2
= AC2 + 4(AC + CB) . CB
= AC2 + 4AB . BC.
Direct sequence from v. or vi.
Since by v. or vi. the rectangle contained by any two lines is = the square
on half their sum ? the square on half their difference; therefore four times the
rectangle contained by any two lines = the square on their sum ? the square
on their difference.
Direct sequence of viii. from iv. and vii.
By iv., the square on the sum = the sum of the squares + twice the rectangle.
By vii., the square on the difference = the sum of the squares ? twice the
rectangle. Therefore, by subtraction, the square on the sum ? the square on
the difference = four times the rectangle.

PROP. IX.—Theorem.
If a line (AB) be bisected (at C) and divided into two unequal parts (at D),
the sum of the squares on the unequal parts (AD, DB) is double the sum of the
squares on half the line (AC), and on the segment (CD) between the points of
section.
Dem.—Erect CE at right angles to AB,
and make it equal to AC or CB. Join AE,
EB. Draw DF parallel to CE, and F G
parallel to CD. Join AF.
Because AC is equal to CE, and the angle ACE is right, the angle CEA is half
a right angle. In like manner the angles
CEB, CBE are half right angles; therefore
the whole angle AEF is right. Again, because GF is parallel to CB, and CE intersects them, the angle EGF is equal to
ECB; but ECB is right (const.); therefore EGF is right; and GEF has been
proved to be half a right angle; therefore the angle GF E is half a right angle [I.
xxxii.]. Therefore [I. vi.] GE is equal to GF. In like manner F D is equal to
DB.
Again, since AC is equal to CE, AC2
is equal to CE2
; but AE2
is equal to
AC2 +CE2
[I. xlvii.]. Therefore AE2
is equal to 2AC2
. In like manner EF2
is
equal to 2GF2 or 2CD2
. Therefore AE2 + EF2
is equal to 2AC2 + 2CD2
; but
AE2+EF2
is equal to AF2
[I. xlvii.]. Therefore AF2
is equal to 2AC2+2CD2
.
Again, since DF is equal to DB, DF2
is equal to DB2
: to each add AD2
,
and we get AD2 + DF2
equal to AD2 + DB2
; but AD2 + DF2
is equal to
AF2
; therefore AF2
is equal to AD2 + DB2
; and we have proved AF2
equal to
2AC2 + 2CD2
. Therefore AD2 + DB2
is equal to 2AC2 + 2CD2
.
Or thus: AD = AC + CD; DB = AC ? CD.
Square and add, and we get AD2 + DB2 = 2AC2 + 2CD2
.

PROP. X.—Theorem.
If a line (AB) be bisected (at C) and divided externally (at D), the sum of
the squares on the segments (AD, DB) made by the external point is equal to
twice the square on half the line, and twice the square on the segment between
the points of section.
Dem.—Erect CE at right angles to AB, and make it equal to
AC or CB. Join AE, EB. Draw
DF parallel to CE, and produce
EB. Now since DF is parallel to
EC, the angle BDF is = to BCE
[I. xxix.], and [I. xv.] the angle
DBF is = to EBC; but the sum of
the angles BCE, EBC is less than
two right angles [I. xvii.]; therefore
the sum of the angles BDF, DBF
is less than two right angles, and therefore [I., Axiom xii.] the lines EB, DF,
if produced, will meet. Let them meet in F. Through F draw F G parallel to
AB, and produce EC to meet it in G. Join AF.
Because AC is equal to CE, and the angle ACE is right, the angle CEA is
half a right angle. In like manner the angles CEB, CBE are half right angles;
therefore the whole angle AEF is right. Again, because GF is parallel to CB,
and GE intersects them, the angle EGF is equal to ECB [I. xxix.]; but ECB
is right (const.); therefore EGF is right, and GEF has been proved to be half
a right angle; therefore [I. xxxii.] GF E is half a right angle, and therefore [I.
vi.] GE is equal to GF. In like manner F D is equal to DB.
Again, since AC is equal to CE, AC2
is equal to CE2
; but AE2
is equal to
AC2 + CE2
[I. xlvii.]; therefore AE2
is equal to 2AC2
. In like manner EF2
is
equal to 2GF2 or 2CD2
; therefore AE2 + EF2
is equal to 2AC2 + 2CD2
; but
AE2+EF2
is equal to AF2
[I. xlvii.]. Therefore AF2
is equal to 2AC2+2CD2
.
Again, since DF is equal to DB, DF2
is equal to DB2
: to each add AD2
,
and we get AD2 + DF2
equal to AD2 + DB2
; but AD2 + DF2
is equal to
60
AF2
; therefore AF2
is equal to AD2 + DB2
; and AF2 has been proved equal
to 2AC2 + 2CD2
. Therefore AD2 + DB2
is equal to 2AC2 + 2CD2
.
Or thus: AD = CD + AC,
BD = CD ? AC.
Square and add, and we get AD2 + BD2 = 2CD2 + 2AC2
.

PROP. XI.—Problem.
To divide a given finite line (AB) into two segments
(in H), so that the rectangle (AB . BH) contained by the
whole line and one segment may be equal to the square
on the other segment.
Sol.—On AB describe the square ABDC [I. xlvi.].
Bisect AC in E. Join BE. Produce EA to F, and make
EF equal to EB. On AF describe the square AF GH.
H is the point required.
Dem.—Produce GH to K. Then because CA is
bisected in E, and divided externally in F, the rectangle
CF . AF, together with the square on EA, is equal to
the square on EF [vi.]; but EF is equal to EB (const.);
61
therefore the rectangle CF . AF, together with EA2
, is equal to EB2—that is
[I. xlvii.] equal to EA2 + AB2
. Rejecting EA2
, which is common, we get the
rectangle CF . AF equal to AB2
. Again, since AF is equal to F G, being the
sides of a square, the rectangle CF . AF is equal to CF . F G—that is, to the
figure CG; and AB2
is equal to the figure AD; therefore CG is equal to AD.
Reject the part AK, which is common, and we get the figure F H equal to the
figure HD; but HD is equal to the rectangle AB . BH, because BD is equal to
AB, and F H is the square on AH. Therefore the rectangle AB . BH is equal to
the square on AH.
Def.—A line divided as in this Proposition is said to be divided in “extreme
and mean ratio.”
Cor. 1.—The line CF is divided in “extreme and mean ratio” at A.
Cor. 2.—If from the greater segment CA of CF we take a segment equal to
AF, it is evident that CA will be divided into parts respectively equal to AH,
HB. Hence, if a line be divided in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment
will be cut in the same manner by taking on it a part equal to the less; and the
less will be similarly divided by taking on it a part equal to the difference, and
so on, &c.
Cor. 3.—Let AB be divided in “extreme
and mean ratio” in C, then it is evident (Cor.
2) that AC is greater than CB. Cut off CD =
CB; then (Cor. 2) AC is cut in “extreme and mean ratio” at D, and CD is
greater than AD. Next, cut off DE equal to AD, and in the same manner we
have DE greater than EC, and so on. Now since CD is greater than AD, it
is evident that CD is not a common measure of AC and CB, and therefore
not a common measure of AB and AC. In like manner AD is not a common
measure of AC and CD, and therefore not a common measure of AB and AC.
Hence, no matter how far we proceed we cannot arrive at any remainder which
will be a common measure of AB and AC. Hence, the parts of a line divided in
“extreme and mean ratio” are incommensurable.
Exercises.
1. Cut a line externally in “extreme and mean ratio.”
2. The difference between the squares on the segments of a line divided in “extreme and
mean ratio” is equal to their rectangle.
3. In a right-angled triangle, if the square on one side be equal to the rectangle contained

(1) AB2 + BC2 = 3AC2

(2) (AB + BC)
2 = 5AC2
.
5. The three lines joining the pairs of points G, B; F, D; A, K, in the construction of

6. If CH intersect BE in O, AO is perpendicular to CH.
7. If CH be produced, it meets BF at right angles.
8. ABC is a right-angled triangle having AB = 2AC: if AH be made equal to the difference
between BC and AC, AB is divided in “extreme and mean ratio” at H.

PROP. XII.—Theorem.
In an obtuse-angled triangle (ABC), the square on the side (AB) subtending
the obtuse angle exceeds the sum of the squares on the sides (BC, CA) containing the obtuse angle, by twice the rectangle contained by either of them (BC),
and its continuation (CD) to meet a perpendicular (AD) on it from the opposite
angle.
Dem.—Because BD is divided into two
parts in C, we have
BD2 = BC2 + CD2 + 2BC . CD [iv.]
and AD2 = AD2
.
Hence, adding, since [I. xlvii.] BD2 + AD2 =
AB2
, and CD2 + AD2 = CA2
, we get
AB2 = BC2 + CA2 + 2BC . CD.
Therefore AB2
is greater than BC2 + CA2
by 2BC . CD.
The foregoing proof differs from Euclid’s only in
the use of symbols. I have found by experience that
pupils more readily understand it than any other
method.
Or thus: By the First Book: Describe squares
on the three sides. Draw AE, BF, CG perpendicular to the sides of the squares. Then it can be
proved exactly as in the demonstration of [I. xlvii.],
that the rectangle BG is equal to BE, AG to AF,
and CE to CF. Hence the sum of the two squares
on AC, CB is less than the square on AB by twice
the rectangle CE; that is, by twice the rectangle
BC . CD.
Cor. 1.—If perpendiculars from A and B to the
opposite sides meet them in H and D, the rectangle
AC . CH is equal to the rectangle BC . CD.

3. ABC is a right-angled triangle, and BD is a perpendicular on the hypotenuse AC;
Prove AB . DC = BD . BC.
4. If a line AB be divided in C so that AC2 = 2CB2

5. If AB be the diameter of a semicircle, find a point C in AB such that, joining C to a fixed
point D in the circumference, and erecting a perpendicular CE meeting the circumference in

6. If the square of a line CD, drawn from the angle C of an equilateral triangle ABC to
a point D in the side AB produced, be equal to 2AB2
; prove that AD is cut in “extreme and
mean ratio” at B.
63
PROP. XIII.—Theorem.
In any triangle (ABC), the square on any side subtending an acute angle (C)
is less than the sum of the squares on the sides containing that angle, by twice
the rectangle (BC, CD) contained by either of them (BC) and the intercept
(CD) between the acute angle and the foot of the perpendicular on it from the
opposite angle.
Dem.—Because BC is divided into two segments in D,
BC2 + CD2 = BD2 + 2BC . CD [vii.];
and AD2 = AD2
.
Hence, adding, since
CD2 + AD2 = AC2
[I. xlvii.],
and BD2 + AD2 = AB2
,
we get BC2 + AC2 = AB2 + 2BC . CD.
Therefore AB2
is less than BC2 + AC2
by 2BC . CD.
Or thus: Describe squares on the sides. Draw AE, BF, CG perpendicular
to the sides; then, as in the demonstration of [I. xlvii.], the rectangle BG is
equal to BE; AG to AF, and CE to CF. Hence the sum of the squares on AC,
CB exceeds the square on AB by twice CE—that is, by 2BC . CD.
Observation.—By comparing the proofs of the pairs of Props. iv. and vii.; v. and vi.;
ix. and x.; xii. and xiii., it will be seen that they are virtually identical. In order to render
this identity more apparent, we have made some slight alterations in the usual proofs. The
pairs of Propositions thus grouped are considered in Modern Geometry not as distinct, but
each pair is regarded as one Proposition.

PROP. XIV.—Problem.
To construct a square equal to a given rectilineal figure (X).
Sol.—Construct [I. xlv.] the rectangle AC equal to X. Then, if the adjacent
sides AB, BC be equal, AC is a square, and the problem is solved; if not,
produce AB to E, and make BE equal to BC; bisect AE in F; with F as
centre and F E as radius, describe the semicircle AGE; produce CB to meet it
in G. The square described on BG will be equal to X.
Dem.—Join F G. Then because AE is divided equally in F and unequally
in B, the rectangle AB . BE, together with F B2
is equal to F E2
[v.], that is,
to F G2
; but F G2
is equal to F B2 + BG2
[I. xlvii.]. Therefore the rectangle
AB . BE +F B2
is equal to F B2 +BG2
. Reject F B2
, which is common, and we
have the rectangle AB . BE = BG2
; but since BE is equal to BC, the rectangle
AB . BE is equal to the figure AC. Therefore BG2
is equal to the figure AC,
and therefore equal to the given rectilineal figure (X).
Cor.—The square on the perpendicular from any point in a semicircle on the
diameter is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the diameter.

BOOK III.
THEORY OF THE CIRCLE
DEFINITIONS.
i. Equal circles are those whose radii are equal.
This is a theorem, and not a definition. For if two circles have equal radii, they are
evidently congruent figures, and therefore equal. From this way of proving this theorem
Props. xxvi.–xxix. follow as immediate inferences.
ii. A chord of a circle is the line joining two points in its circumference.
If the chord be produced both ways, the whole line is called a secant, and each of the
parts into which a secant divides the circumference is called an arc—the greater the major
conjugate arc, and the lesser the minor conjugate arc.—Newcomb.
iii. A right line is said to touch a circle when
it meets the circle, and, being produced both
ways, does not cut it; the line is called a tangent
to the circle, and the point where it touches it
the point of contact.
In Modern Geometry a curve is considered as made
up of an infinite number of points, which are placed in
order along the curve, and then the secant through two
consecutive points is a tangent. Euclid’s definition for a
tangent is quite inadequate for any curve but the circle,
and those derived from it by projection (the conic sections); and even for these the modern
definition is better.
iv. Circles are said to touch one another when they meet, but do not intersect. There are two species of contact:—
1. When each circle is external to the
other.
2. When one is inside the other.
The following is the modern definition of
curve-contact:— When two curves have two,
three, four, &c., consecutive points common,
they have contact of the first, second, third, &c., orders.
v. A segment of a circle is a figure bounded by a chord and one of the arcs
into which it divides the circumference.
vi. Chords are said to be equally distant from the centre when the perpendiculars drawn to them from the centre are equal.
vii. The angle contained by two lines, drawn from any point in the circumference of a segment to the extremities of its chord, is called an angle in the
segment.
68
viii. The angle of a segment is the angle contained between its chord and
the tangent at either extremity.
A theorem is tacitly assumed in this Definition, namely, that the angles which the chord
makes with the tangent at its extremities are equal. We shall prove this further on.
ix. An angle in a segment is said to stand on its conjugate arc.
x. Similar segments of circles are those that contain
equal angles.
xi. A sector of a circle is formed of two radii and
the arc included between them.
To a pair of radii may belong either of the two conjugate arcs
into which their ends divide the circle.—Newcomb.
xii. Concentric circles are those that have the same centre.
xiii. Points which lie on the circumference of a circle are said to be concyclic.
xiv. A cyclic quadrilateral is one which is inscribed in a circle.
xv. It will be proper to give here an explanation of the extended meaning of
the word angle in Modern Geometry. This extension is necessary in Trigonometry, in Mechanics—in fact, in every application of Geometry, and has been
partly given in I. Def. ix.
Thus, if a line OA revolve about the point O, as in figures 1, 2, 3, 4, until
it comes into the position OB, the amount of the rotation from OA to OB is
called an angle. From the diagrams we see that in fig. 1 it is less than two right
angles; in fig. 2 it is equal to two right angles; in fig. 3 greater than two right
angles, but less than four; and in fig. 4 it is greater than four right angles. The
arrow-heads denote the direction or sense, as it is technically termed, in which
the line OA turns. It is usual to call the direction indicated in the above figures
positive, and the opposite negative. A line such as OA, which turns about a
fixed point, is called a ray, and then we have the following definition:—
xvi. A ray which turns in the sense opposite to the hands of a watch describes
a positive angle, and one which turns in the same direction as the hands, a
negative angle.
PROP. I.—Problem.
To find the centre of a given circle (ADB).
69
Sol.—Take any two points A, B in the circumference. Join AB. Bisect it in C. Erect CD at right
angles to AB. Produce DC to meet the circle again
in E. Bisect DE in F. Then F is the centre.
Dem.—If possible, let any other point G be the
centre. Join GA, GC, GB. Then in the triangles
ACG, BCG we have AC equal to CB (const.), CG
common, and the base GA equal to GB, because they
are drawn from G, which is, by hypothesis, the centre,
to the circumference. Hence [I. viii.] the angle ACG is equal to the adjacent
angle BCG, and therefore [I. Def. xiii.] each is a right angle; but the angle
ACD is right (const.); therefore ACD is equal to ACG—a part equal to the
whole—which is absurd. Hence no point can be the centre which is not in the
line DE. Therefore F, the middle point of DE, must be the centre.
The foregoing proof may be abridged as follows:—
Because ED bisects AB at right angles, every point equally distant from, the
points A, B must lie in ED [I. x. Ex. 2]; but the centre is equally distant from
A and B; hence the centre must be in ED; and since it must be equally distant
from E and D, it must be the middle point of DE.
Cor. 1.—The line which bisects any chord of a circle perpendicularly passes
through the centre of the circle.
Cor. 2.—The locus of the centres of the circles which pass through two fixed
points is the line bisecting at right angles that connecting the two points.
Cor. 3.—If A, B, C be three points in the circumference of a circle, the lines
bisecting perpendicularly the chords AB, BC intersect in the centre.
PROP. II.—Theorem.
If any two points (A, B) be taken in the circumference of a circle—1. The
segment (AB) of the indefinite line through these points which lies between them
falls within the circle. 2. The remaining parts of the line are without the circle.
Dem.—1. Let C be the centre. Take any
point D in AB. Join CA, CD, CB. Now the
angle ADC is [I. xvi.] greater than ABC;
but the angle ABC is equal to CAB [I. v.],
because the triangle CAB is isosceles; therefore the angle ADC is greater than CAD.
Hence AC is greater than CD [I. xix.]; therefore CD is less than the radius of the circle,
consequently the point D must be within the
circle (note on I. Def. xxiii.).
In the same manner every other point between A and B lies within the circle.
2. Take any point E in AB produced either way. Join CE. Then the angle
ABC is greater than AEC [I. xvi.]; therefore CAB is greater than AEC. Hence
CE is greater than CA, and the point E is without the circle.
70
We have added the second part of this Proposition. The indirect proof given of the first
part in several editions of Euclid is very inelegant; it is one of those absurd things which give
many students a dislike to Geometry.
Cor. 1.—Three collinear points cannot be concyclic.
Cor. 2.—A line cannot meet a circle in more than two points.
Cor. 3.—The circumference of a circle is everywhere concave towards the
centre.
PROP. III.–Theorem.
If a line (AB) passing through the centre of a circle bisect a chord (CD),
which does not pass through the centre, it cuts it at right angles. 2. If it cuts it
at right angles, it bisects it.
Dem.—1. Let O be the centre of the circle.
Join OC, OD. Then the triangles CEO, DEO
have CE equal to ED (hyp.), EO common, and
OC equal to OD, because they are radii of the
circle; hence [I. viii.] the angle CEO is equal to
DEO, and they are adjacent angles. Therefore [I.
Def. xiii.] each is a right angle. Hence AB cuts
CD at right angles.
2. The same construction being made: because
OC is equal to OD, the angle OCD is equal to
ODC [I. v.], and CEO is equal to DEO (hyp.), because each is right. Therefore
the triangles CEO, DEO have two angles in one respectively equal to two angles
in the other, and the side EO common. Hence [I. xxvi.] the side CE is equal
to ED. Therefore CD is bisected in E.
2. May be proved as follows:—
OC2 = OE2+EC2
[I. xlvii.], and OD2 = OE2 + ED2
;
but OC2 =OD2
; ? OE2 + EC2 = OE2 + ED2
.
Hence EC2 = ED2
, and EC = ED.
Observation.—The three theorems, namely, Cor. 1., Prop. i., and Parts 1, 2, of Prop. iii.,
are so related, that any one being proved directly, the other two follow by the Rule of Identity.
Cor. 1.—The line which bisects perpendicularly one of two parallel chords
of a circle bisects the other perpendicularly.
Cor. 2.—The locus of the middle points of a system of parallel chords of a
circle is the diameter of the circle perpendicular to them all.
Cor. 3.—If a line intersect two concentric circles, its intercepts between the
circles are equal.
Cor. 4.—The line joining the centres of two intersecting circles bisects their
common chord perpendicularly.
71
Exercises.
1. If a chord of a circle subtend a right angle at a given point, the locus of its middle point
is a circle.
2. Every circle passing through a given point, and having its centre on a given line, passes
through another given point.
3. Draw a chord in a given circle which shall subtend a right angle at a given point, and
be parallel to a given line.
PROP. IV.—Theorem.
Two chords of a circle (AB, CD) which are not both diameters cannot bisect
each other, though either may bisect the other.
Dem.—Let O be the centre. Let AB, CD intersect in E; then since AB, CD are not both diameters, join OE. If possible let AE be equal to
EB, and CE equal to ED. Now, since OE passing through the centre bisects AB, which does not
pass through the centre, it is at right angles to it;
therefore the angle AEO is right. In like manner
the angle CEO is right. Hence AEO is equal to
CEO—that is, a part equal to the whole—which
is absurd. Therefore AB and CD do not bisect each other.
Cor.—If two chords of a circle bisect each other, they are both diameters.
PROP. V.—Theorem.
If two circles (ABC, ABD) cut one another in any point (A), they are not
concentric.
Dem.—If possible let them have a common
centre at O. Join OA, and draw any other line
OD, cutting the circles in C and D respectively.
Then because O is the centre of the circle ABC,
OA is equal to OC. Again, because O is the centre
of the circle ABD, OA is equal to OD. Hence OC
is equal to OD—a part equal to the whole—which
is absurd. Therefore the circles are not concentric.
Exercises.
1. If two non-concentric circles intersect in one point, they must intersect in another point.
For, let O, O0 be the centres, A the point of intersection; from A let fall the ? AC on the line
OO0
. Produce AC to B, making BC = CA: then B is another point of intersection.
2. Two circles cannot have three points in common without wholly coinciding.
72
PROP. VI.—Theorem.
If one circle (ABC) touch another circle (ADE)
internally in any point (A), it is not concentric with
it.
Dem.—If possible let the circles be concentric,
and let O be the centre of each. Join OA, and draw
any other line OD, cutting the circles in the points
B, D respectively. Then because O is the centre of
each circle (hyp.), OB and OD are each equal to
OA; therefore OB is equal to OD, which is impossible. Hence the circles cannot have the same centre.
PROP. VII.—Theorem.
If from any point (P) within a circle, which is not the centre, lines (P A, P B,
P C, &c.), one of which passes through the centre, be drawn to the circumference,
then—1. The greatest is the line (P A) which passes through the centre. 2. The
production (P E) of this in the opposite direction is the least. 3. Of the others,
that which is nearest to the line through the centre is greater than every one more
remote. 4. Any two lines making equal angles with the diameter on opposite
sides are equal. 5. More than two equal right lines cannot be drawn from the
given point (P) to the circumference.
Dem.—1. Let O be the centre. Join OB. Now since O is the centre, OA is
equal to OB: to each add OP, and we have AP equal to the sum of OB, OP;
but the sum of OB, OP is greater than P B [I. xx.]. Therefore P A is greater
than P B.
2. Join OD. Then [I. xx.] the sum of OP,
P D is greater than OD; but OD is equal to OE
[I. Def. xxx.]. Therefore the sum of OP, P D is
greater than OE. Reject OP, which is common,
and we have P D greater than P E.
3. Join OC; then two triangles P OB, P OC
have the side OB equal to OC [I. Def. xxx.],
and OP common; but the angle P OB is greater
than P OC; therefore [I. xxiv.] the base P B is
greater than P C. In like manner P C is greater
than P D.
4. Make at the centre O the angle P OF equal
to P OD. Join P F. Then the triangles P OD, P OF have the two sides OP,
OD in one respectively equal to the sides OP, OF in the other, and the angle
P OD equal to the angle P OF; hence P D is equal to P F [I. iv.], and the angle
OP D equal to the angle OP F. Therefore P D and P F make equal angles with
the diameter.
73
5. A third line cannot be drawn from P equal to either of the equal lines
P D, P F. If possible let P G be equal to P D, then P G is equal to P F—that is,
the line which is nearest to the one through the centre is equal to the one which
is more remote, which is impossible. Hence three equal lines cannot be drawn
from P to the circumference.
Cor. 1.—If two equal lines P D, P F be drawn from a point P to the circumference of a circle, the diameter through P bisects the angle DP F formed by
these lines.
Cor. 2.—If P be the common centre of circles whose radii are P A, P B, P C,
&c., then—1. The circle whose radius is the maximum line (P A) lies outside
the circle ADE, and touches it in A [Def. iv.]. 2. The circle whose radius is
the minimum line (P E) lies inside the circle ADE, and touches it in E. 3. A
circle having any of the remaining lines (P D) as radius cuts ADE in two points
(D, F).
Observation.—Proposition vii. affords a good illustration of the following important definition (see Sequel to Euclid, p. 13):—If a geometrical magnitude varies its position continuously
according to any law, and if it retains the same value throughout, it is said to be a constant,
such as the radius of a circle revolving round the centre; but if it goes on increasing for some
time, and then begins to decrease, it is said to be a maximum at the end of the increase.
Thus, in the foregoing figure, P A, supposed to revolve round P and meet the circle, is a
maximum. Again, if it decreases for some time, and then begins to increase, it is a minimum
at the commencement of the increase. Thus P E, supposed as before to revolve round P and
meet the circle, is a minimum. Proposition viii. will give other illustrations.
PROP. VIII.—Theorem.
If from any point (P) outside a circle, lines (P A, P B, P C, &c.) be drawn
to the concave circumference, then—
1. The maximum is that which passes
through the centre. 2. Of the others,
that which is nearer to the one through
the centre is greater than the one more
remote. Again, if lines be drawn to
the convex circumference—3. The minimum is that whose production passes
through the centre. 4. Of the others, that which is nearer to the minimum is less than one more remote.
5. From the given point (P) there can be
drawn two equal lines to the concave or
the convex circumference, both of which
make equal angles with the line passing
through the centre. 6. More than two
equal lines cannot be drawn from the given point (P) to either circumference.
Dem.—1. Let O be the centre. Join OB. Now since O is the centre, OA is
equal to OB: to each add OP, and we have AP equal to the sum of OB, OP;
74
but the sum of OB, OP is greater than BP [I. xx.]. Therefore AP is greater
than BP.
2. Join OC, OD. The two triangles BOP, COP have the side OB equal
to OC, and OP common, and the angle BOP greater than COP; therefore the
base BP is greater than CP [I. xxiv.]. In like manner CP is greater than DP,
&c.
3. Join OF. Now in the triangle OF P the sum of the sides OF, F P is
greater than OP [I. xx.]; but OF is equal to OE [I. Def. xxx.]. Reject them,
and F P will remain greater than EP.
4. Join OG, OH. The two triangles GOP, F OP have two sides GO, OP in
one respectively equal to two sides F O, OP in the other; but the angle GOP
is greater than F OP; therefore [I. xxiv.] the base GP is greater than F P. In
like manner HP is greater than GP.
5. Make the angle P OI equal P OF [I. xxiii.]. Join IP. Now the triangles
IOP, F OP have two sides IO, OP in one respectively equal to two sides F O,
OP in the other, and the angle IOP equal to F OP (const.); therefore [I. iv.]
IP is equal to F P.
6. A third line cannot be drawn from P equal to either of the lines IP, F P.
For if possible let PK be equal to P F; then PK is equal to P I—that is, one
which is nearer to the minimum equal to one more remote—which is impossible.
Cor. 1.—If P I be produced to meet the circle again in L, P L is equal to
P B.
Cor. 2.—If two equal lines be drawn from P to either the convex or concave
circumference, the diameter through P bisects the angle between them, and the
parts of them intercepted by the circle are equal.
Cor. 3.—If P be the common centre of circles whose radii are lines drawn
from P to the circumference of HDE, then—1. The circle whose radius is the
minimum line (P E) has contact of the first kind with ADE [Def. iv.]. 2. The
circle whose radius is the maximum line (P A) has contact of the second kind.
3. A circle having any of the remaining lines (P F) as radius intersects HDE in
two points (F, I).
PROP. IX.—Theorem.
A point (P) within a circle (ABC), from which
more than two equal lines (P A, P B, P C, &c.) can
be drawn to the circumference, is the centre.
Dem.—If P be not the centre, let O be the centre. Join OP, and produce it to meet the circle in D
and E; then DE is the diameter, and P is a point in
it which is not the centre: therefore [vii.] only two
equal lines can be drawn from P to the circumference; but three equal lines are drawn (hyp.), which
is absurd. Hence P must be the centre.
75
Or thus: Since the lines AP, BP are equal, the line bisecting the angle AP B [vii. Cor. 1]
must pass through the centre: in like manner the line bisecting the angle BP C must pass
through the centre. Hence the point of intersection of these bisectors, that is, the point P,
must be the centre.
PROP. X.—Theorem.
If two circles have more than two points common, they must coincide.
Dem.—Let X be one of the circles; and if
possible let another circle Y have three points, A,
B, C, in common with X, without coinciding with
it. Find P, the centre of X. Join P A, P B, P C.
Then since P is the centre of X, the three lines
P A, P B, P C are equal to one another.
Again, since Y is a circle and P a point, from
which three equal lines P A, P B, P C can be
drawn to its circumference, P must be the centre of Y . Hence X and Y are concentric, which
[v.] is impossible.
Cor.—Two circles not coinciding cannot have more than two points common.
Compare I., Axiom x., that two right lines not coinciding cannot have more than
one point common.
PROP. XI.—Theorem.
If one circle (CP D) touch another circle (AP B) internally at any point P, the
line joining the centres must pass through that point.
Dem.—Let O be the centre of AP B. Join OP.
I say the centre of the smaller circle is in the line
OP. If not, let it be in any other position such as
E. Join OE, EP, and produce OE through E to
meet the circles in the points C, A. Now since E is a
point in the diameter of the larger circle between the
centre and A, EA is less than EP [vii. 2]; but EP is
equal to EC (hyp.), being radii of the smaller circle.
Hence EA is less than EC; which is impossible;
consequently the centre of the smaller circle must
be in the line OP. Let it be H; then we see that the line joining the centres
passes through the point P.
Or thus: Since EP is a line drawn from a point within the circle AP B to
the circumference, but not forming part of the diameter through E, the circle
whose centre is E and radius EP cuts [vii., Cor. 2] AP B in P, but it touches
it (hyp.) also in P, which is impossible. Hence the centre of the smaller circle
CP D must be in the line OP.
76
PROP. XII.—Theorem.
If two circles (P CF, P DE) have external contact at any point P, the line
joining their centres must pass through that point.
Dem.—Let A be the centre of one of
the circles. Join AP, and produce it to
meet the second circle again in E. I say
the centre of the second circle is in the line
P E. If not, let it be elsewhere, as at B.
Join AB, intersecting the circles in C and
D, and join BP. Now since A is the centre
of the circle P CF, AP is equal to AC; and since B is the centre of the circle
P DE, BP is equal to BD. Hence the sum of the lines AP, BP is equal to
the sum of the lines AC, DB; but AB is greater than the sum of AC and DB;
therefore AB is greater than the sum of AP, P B—that is, one side of a triangle
greater than the sum of the other two–which [I. xx.] is impossible. Hence the
centre of the second circle must be in the line P E. Let it be G, and we see that
the line through the centres passes through the point P.
Or thus: Since BP is a line drawn from a point without the circle P CF
to its circumference, and when produced does not pass through the centre, the
circle whose centre is B and radius BP must cut the circle P CF in P [viii.,
Cor. 3]; but it touches it (hyp.) also in P, which is impossible. Hence the centre
of the second circle must be in the line P E.
Observation.—Propositions xi, xii., may both be included in one enunciation as follows:—
“If two circles touch each other at any point, the centres and that point are collinear.” And this
latter Proposition is a limiting case of the theorem given in Proposition iii., Cor. 4, that “The
line joining the centres of two intersecting circles bisects the common chord perpendicularly.”
Suppose the circle whose centre is O and one of the points of intersection A to remain
fixed, while the second circle turns round that point in such a manner that the second point
of intersection B becomes ultimately consecutive to A; then, since the line OO0 always bisects
AB, we see that when B ultimately becomes consecutive to A, the line OO0 passes through
A. In consequence of the motion, the common chord will become in the limit a tangent to
each circle, as in the second diagram.—Comberousse, G´eom´etrie Plane, page 57.
Cor. 1.—If two circles touch each other, their point of contact is the union of two points
of intersection. Hence a contact counts for two intersections.
77
Cor. 2.—If two circles touch each other at any point, they
cannot have any other common point. For, since two circles
cannot have more than two points common [x.], and that the
point of contact is equivalent to two common points, circles that
touch cannot have any other point common. The following is a
formal proof of this Proposition:—Let O, O0 be the centres of
the two circles, A the point of contact, and let O0
lie between O
and A; take any other point B in the circumference of O. Join
O0B; then [vii.] O0B is greater than O0A; therefore the point C
is outside the circumference of the smaller circle. Hence B cannot be common to both circles.
In like manner, they cannot have any other common point but A.
PROP. XIII.—Theorem.
Two circles cannot have double contact, that it, cannot touch each other in two
points.
Dem.—1. If possible let two circles touch each
other at two points A and B. Now since the two
circles touch each other in A, the line joining their
centres passes through A [xi.]. In like manner,
it passes through B. Hence the centres and the
points A, B are in one right line; therefore AB is a
diameter of each circle. Hence, if AB be bisected
in E, E must be the centre of each circle—that is,
the circles are concentric—which [v.] is impossible.
2. If two circles touched each other externally in two distinct points, then
[xii.] the line joining the centres should pass through each point, which is
impossible.
Or thus: Draw a line bisecting AB at right angles. Then this line [i., Cor. 1]
must pass through the centre of each circle, and therefore [xi. xii.] must pass
through each point of contact, which is impossible. Hence two circles cannot
have double contact.
This Proposition is an immediate inference from the theorem [xii., Cor. 1], that a point
of contact counts for two intersections, for then two contacts would be equivalent to four
intersections; but there cannot be more than two intersections [x.]. It also follows from
Prop. xii., Cor. 2, that if two circles touch each other in a point A, they cannot have any
other point common; hence they cannot touch again in B.
Exercises.
1. If a variable circle touch two fixed circles externally, the difference of the distances of
its centre from the centres of the fixed circles is equal to the difference or the sum of their
radii, according as the contacts are of the same or of opposite species (Def. iv.).
2. If a variable circle be touched by one of two fixed circles internally, and touch the
other fixed circle either externally or internally, the sum of the distances of its centre from
the centres of the fixed circles is equal to the sum or the difference of their radii, according as
the contact with the second circle is of the first or second kind.
3. If through the point of contact of two touching circles any secant be drawn cutting the
circles again in two points, the radii drawn to these points are parallel.
78
4. If two diameters of two touching circles be parallel, the lines from the point of contact
to the extremities of one diameter pass through the extremities of the other.
PROP. XIV.—Theorem.
In equal circles—1. equal chords (AB, CD) are equally distant from the
centre. 2. chords which are equally distant from the centre are equal.
Dem.—1. Let O be the centre. Draw the perpendiculars OE, OF. Join AO, CO. Then because
AB is a chord in a circle, and OE is drawn from
the centre cutting it at right angles, it bisects it
[iii.]; therefore AE is the half of AB. In like manner, CF is the half of CD; but AB is equal to
CD (hyp.). Therefore AE is equal to CF [I., Axiom vii.]. And because E is a right angle, AO2
is
equal to AE2 + EO2
. In like manner, CO2
is equal
to CF2 + F O2
; but AO2
is equal to CO2
. Therefore
AE2 + EO2
is equal to CF2 + F O2
; and AE2 has been proved equal to CF2
.
Hence EO2
is equal to F O2
; therefore EO is equal to F O. Hence AB, CD are
(Def. vi.) equally distant from the centre.
2. Let EO be equal to F O, it is required to prove AB equal to CD. The same
construction being made, we have, as before, AE2 + EO2
equal to CF2 + F O2
;
but EO2
is equal to F O2
(hyp.). Hence AE2
is equal to CF2
, and AE is equal
to CF; but AB is double of AE, and CD double of CF. Therefore AB is equal
to CD.
Exercise.
If a chord of given length slide round a fixed circle—1. the locus of its middle point is a
circle; 2. the locus of any point fixed in the chord is a circle.
PROP. XV.—Theorem.
The diameter (AB) is the greatest chord in a circle; and of the others, the
chord (CD) which is nearer to the centre is greater than (EF) one more remote,
and the greater is nearer to the centre than the less.
Dem.—1. Join OC, OD, OE, and draw the
perpendiculars OG, OH; then because O is the
centre, OA is equal to OC [I., Def. xxxii.], and
OB is equal to OD. Hence AB is equal to the
sum of OC and OD; but the sum of OC, OD is
greater than CD [I. xx.]. Therefore AB is greater
than CD.
2. Because the chord CD is nearer to the centre than EF, OG is less than OH; and since the
79
triangles OGC, OHE are right-angled, we have OC2 = OG2 + GC2
, and
OE2 = OH2 + HE2
; therefore OG2 + GC2 = OH2 + HE2
; but OG2
is less
than OH2
; therefore GC2
is greater than HE2
, and GC is greater than HE,
but CD and EF are the doubles of GC and HE. Hence CD is greater than
EF.
3. Let CD be greater than EF, it is required to prove that OG is less than
OH.
As before, we have OG2 + GC2
equal to OH2 + HE2
; but CG2
is greater
than EH2
; therefore OG2
is less than OH2
. Hence OG is less than OH.
Exercises.
1. The shortest chord which can be drawn through a given point within a circle is the
perpendicular to the diameter which passes through that point.
2. Through a given point, within or without a given circle, draw a chord of length equal
to that of a given chord.
3. Through one of the points of intersection of two circles draw a secant—1. the sum of
whose segments intercepted by the circles shall be a maximum; 2. which shall be of any length
less than that of the maximum.
4. Three circles touch each other externally at A, B, C; the chords AB, AC of two of them
are produced to meet the third again in the points D and E; prove that DE is a diameter of
the third circle, and parallel to the line joining the centres of the others.
PROP. XVI.—Theorem.
1. The perpendicular (BI) to the diameter (AB) of a circle at its extremity
(B) touches the circle at that point. 2. Any other line (BH) through the same
point cuts the circle.
Dem.—1. Take any point I, and join it to
the centre C. Then because the angle CBI is a
right angle, CI2
is equal to CB2+BI2
[I. xlvii.];
therefore CI2
is greater than CB2
. Hence CI
is greater than CB, and the point I [note on I.,
Def. xxxii.] is without the circle. In like manner,
every other point in BI, except B, is without the
circle. Hence, since BI meets the circle at B, but
does not cut it, it must touch it.
2. To prove that BH, which is not perpendicular to AB, cuts the circle. Draw CG perpendicular to HB. Now BC2
is
equal to CG2 + GB2
. Therefore BC2
is greater than CG2
, and BC is greater
than CG. Hence [note on I., Def. xxxii.] the point G must be within the circle,
and consequently the line BG produced must meet the circle again, and must
therefore cut it.
This Proposition may be proved as follows:
At every point on a circle the tangent is perpendicular to the radius.
80
Let P and Q be two consecutive points on the circumference. Join CP, CQ, P Q; produce P Q both
ways. Now since P and Q are consecutive points, P Q
is a tangent (Def. iii.). Again, the sum of the three
angles of the triangle CP Q is equal to two right angles;
but the angle C is infinitely small, and the others are
equal. Hence each of them is a right angle. Therefore
the tangent is perpendicular to the diameter.
Or thus: A tangent is a limiting position of a secant, namely, when the
secant moves out until the two points of intersection with the circle become
consecutive; but the line through the centre which bisects the part of the secant
within the circle [iii.] is perpendicular to it. Hence, in the limit the tangent is
perpendicular to the line from the centre to the point of contact.
Or again: The angle CP R is always equal to CQS; hence, when P and
Q come together each is a right angle, and the tangent is perpendicular to the
radius.
Exercises.
1. If two circles be concentric, all chords of the greater which touch the lesser are equal.
2. Draw a parallel to a given line to touch a given circle.
3. Draw a perpendicular to a given line to touch a given circle.

touching a given circle. How many solutions of this case?

shall touch two given circles.
PROP. XVII.—Problem.
From a given point (P) without a given circle (BCD) to draw a tangent to the
circle.
81
Sol.—Let O (fig. 1) be the centre of the given circle. Join OP, cutting the
circumference in C. With O as centre, and OP as radius, describe the circle
AP E. Erect CA at right angles to OP. Join OA, intersecting the circle BCD
in B. Join BP; it will be the tangent required.
Dem.—Since O is the centre of the two circles, we have OA equal to OP,
and OC equal to OB. Hence the two triangles AOC, P OB have the sides
OA, OC in one respectively equal to the sides OP, OB in the other, and the
contained angle common to both. Hence [I. iv.] the angle OCA is equal to
OBP; but OCA is a right angle (const.); therefore OBP is a right angle, and
[xvi.] P B touches the circle at B.
Cor.—If AC (fig. 2) be produced to E, OE joined, cutting the circle BCD
in D, and the line DP drawn, DP will be another tangent from P.
Exercises.
1. The two tangents P B, P D (fig. 2) are equal to one another, because the square of each
is equal to the square of OP minus the square of the radius.
2. If two circles be concentric, all tangents to the inner from points on the outer are equal.
3. If a quadrilateral be circumscribed to a circle, the sum of one pair of opposite sides is
equal to the sum of the other pair.
4. If a parallelogram be circumscribed to a circle it must be a lozenge, and its diagonals
intersect in the centre.
5. If BD be joined, intersecting OP in F, OP is perpendicular to BD.
6. The locus of the intersection of two equal tangents to two circles is a right line (called
the radical axis of the two circles).
7. Find a point such that tangents from it to three given circles shall be equal. (This point
is called the radical centre of the three circles.)
8. The rectangle OF . OP is equal to the square of the radius.
Def. Two points, such as F and P, the rectangle of whose distances OF, OP from the
centre is equal to the square of the radius, are called inverse points with respect to the circle.
9. The intercept made on a variable tangent by two fixed tangents subtends a constant
angle at the centre.
10. Draw a common tangent to two circles. Hence, show how to draw a line cutting two
circles, so that the intercepted chords shall be of given lengths.
PROP. XVIII.—Theorem
If a line (CD) touch a circle, the line (OC) from the centre to the point of
contact is perpendicular to it.
Dem.—If not, suppose another line OG
drawn from the centre to be perpendicular to
CD. Let OG cut the circle in F. Then because
the angle OGC is right (hyp.) the angle OCG
[I. xvii.] must be acute. Therefore [I. xix.]
OC is greater than OG; but OC is equal to OF
[I. Def. xxxii.]; therefore OF is greater than
OG—that is, a part greater than the whole,
which is impossible. Hence OC must be perpendicular to CD.
82
Or thus: Since the perpendicular must be the shortest line from O to CD, and OC is
evidently the shortest line; therefore OC must be perpendicular to CD.
PROP. XIX.—Theorem.
If a line (AB) be a tangent to a circle, the line (AC) drawn at right angles to
it from the point of contact passes through the centre.
If the centre be not in AC, let O be the
centre. Join AO. Then because AB touches the
circle, and OA is drawn from the centre to the
point of contact, OA is at right angles to AB
[xviii.]; therefore the angle OAB is right, and
the angle CAB is right (hyp.); therefore OAB
is equal to CAB—a part equal to the whole,
which is impossible. Hence the centre must be
in the line AC.
Cor.—If a number of circles touch the same
line at the same point, the locus of their centres
is the perpendicular to the line at the point.
Observation.—Propositions xvi., xviii., xix., are so related that any two can be inferred
from the third by the “Rule of Identity.” Hence it would, in strict logic, be sufficient to prove
any one of the three, and the others would follow. Again, these three theorems are limiting
cases of Proposition i., Cor. 1., and Parts 1, 2, of Proposition iii., namely, when the points in
which the chord cuts the circle become consecutive.
PROP. XX.—Theorem.
The angle (AOB) at the centre (O) of a circle is double the angle (ACB) at
the circumference standing on the same arc.
Dem.—Join CO, and produce it to E. Then because OA is equal to OC,
the angle ACO is equal to OAC; but the angle AOE is equal to the sum of the
two angles OAC, ACO. Hence the angle AOE is double the angle ACO. In like
83
manner the angle EOB is double the angle OCB. Hence (by adding in figs. (?),
(?), and subtracting in (?)), the angle AOB is double of the angle ACB.
Cor.—If AOB be a straight line, ACB will be a right angle—that is, the
angle in a semicircle is a right angle (compare xxxi.).
PROP. XXI.—Theorem.
The angles (ACB, ADB) in the same segment of a circle are equal.
Dem.—Let O be the centre. Join OA, OB. Then the angle AOB is double
of the angle ACB [xx.], and also double of the angle ADB. Therefore the angle
ACB is equal to the angle ADB.
The following is the proof of the second part—that is, when the arc AB
is not greater than a semicircle, without using angles greater than two right
angles:—
Let O be the centre. Join CO, and produce
it to meet the circle again in E. Join DE. Now
since O is the centre, the segment ACE is greater
than a semicircle; hence, by the first case, fig. (?),
the angle ACE is equal to ADE. In like manner
the angle ECB is equal to EDB. Hence the whole
angle ACB is equal to the whole angle ADB.
Cor. 1.—If two triangles ACB, ADB on the
same base AB, and on the same side of it, have
equal vertical angles, the four points A, C, D, B are concyclic.
Cor. 2.—If A, B be two fixed points, and if C varies its position in such a
way that the angle ACB retains the same value throughout, the locus of C is a
circle.
In other words—Given the base of a triangle and the vertical angle, the locus
of the vertex is a circle.
84
Exercises.
1. Given the base of a triangle and the vertical angle, find the locus—
(1) of the intersection of its perpendiculars;
(2) of the intersection of the internal bisectors of its base angles;
(3) of the intersection of the external bisectors of the base angles;
(4) of the intersection of the external bisector of one base angle and the internal bisector
of the other.
2. If the sum of the squares of two lines be given, their sum is a maximum when the lines
are equal.
3. Of all triangles having the same base and vertical angle, the sum of the sides of an
isosceles triangle is a maximum.
4. Of all triangles inscribed in a circle, the equilateral triangle has the maximum perimeter.
5. Of all concyclic figures having a given number of sides, the area is a maximum when
the sides are equal.
PROP. XXII.—Theorem.
The sum of the opposite angles of a quadrilateral (ABCD) inscribed in a circle
is two right angles.
Dem.—Join AC, BD. The angle ABD is equal to ACD, being in the same
segment ABCD [xxi.]; and the angle DBC is equal to DAC, because they are
in the same segment DABC. Hence the whole angle ABC is equal to the sum
of the two angles ACD, DAC. To each add the angle CDA, and we have the
sum of the two angles ABC, CDA equal to the sum of the three angles ACD,
DAC, CDA of the triangle ACD; but the sum of the three angles of a triangle
is equal to two right angles [I. xxxii.]. Therefore the sum of ABC, CDA is two
right angles.
Or thus: Let O be the centre of the circle. Join OA, OC (see fig. 2). Now
the angle AOC is double of CDA [xx.], and the angle COA is double of ABC.
Hence the sum of the angles [I. Def. ix., note] AOC, COA is double of the sum
of the angles CDA, ABC; but the sum of two angles AOC, COA is four right
angles. Therefore the sum of the angles CDA, ABC is two right angles.
Or again: Let O be the centre (fig. 2). Join OA, OB OC, OD. Then the
four triangles AOB, BOC, COD, DOA are each isosceles. Hence the angle
OAB is equal to the angle OBA, and the angle OAD equal to the angle ODA;
therefore the angle BAD is equal to the sum of the angles OBA, ODA. In like
85
manner the angle BCD is equal to the sum of the angles OBC, ODC. Hence
the sum of the two angles BAD, BCD is equal to the sum of the two angles
ABC, ADC, and hence each sum is two right angles.
Cor.—If a parallelogram be inscribed in a circle it is a rectangle.
Exercises.
1. If the opposite angles of a quadrilateral be supplemental, it is cyclic.
2. If a figure of six sides be inscribed in a circle, the sum of any three alternate angles is
four right angles.
3. A line which makes equal angles with one pair of opposite sides of a cyclic quadrilateral,
makes equal angles with the remaining pair and with the diagonals.
4. If two opposite sides of a cyclic quadrilateral be produced to meet, and a perpendicular
be let fall on the bisector of the angle between them from the point of intersection of the
diagonals, this perpendicular will bisect the angle between the diagonals.
5. If two pairs of opposite sides of a cyclic hexagon be respectively parallel to each other,
the remaining pair of sides are also parallel.
6. If two circles intersect in the points A, B, and any two lines ACD, BF E, be drawn
through A and B, cutting one of the circles in the points C, E, and the other in the points
D, F, the line CE is parallel to DF.
7. If equilateral triangles be described on the sides of any triangle, the lines joining the
vertices of the original triangle to the opposite vertices of the equilateral triangles are concurrent.
8. In the same case prove that the centres of the circles described about the equilateral
triangles form another equilateral triangle.
9. If a quadrilateral be described about a circle, the angles at the centre subtended by the
opposite sides are supplemental.
10. The perpendiculars of a triangle are concurrent.
11. If a variable tangent meets two parallel tangents it subtends a right angle at the centre.
12. The feet of the perpendiculars let fall on the sides of a triangle from any point in the
circumference of the circumscribed circle are collinear (Simson).
Def.—The line of collinearity is called Simson’s line.
13. If a hexagon be circumscribed about a circle, the sum of the angles subtended at the
centre by any three alternate sides is equal to two right angles.
PROP. XXIII—Theorem.
Two similar segments of circles which do not coincide cannot be constructed
on the same chord (AB), and on the same side of that chord.
Dem.—If possible, let ACB, ADB, be
two similar segments constructed on the
same side of AB. Take any point D in the
inner one. Join AD, and produce it to meet
the outer one in C. Join BC, BD. Then
since the segments are similar, the angle ADB is equal to ACB (Def. x.),
which is impossible [I. xvi.]. Hence two similar segments not coinciding cannot
be described on the same chord and on the same side of it.
86
PROP. XXIV.—Theorem.
Similar segments of circles (AEB, CF D) on equal chords (AB, CD) are
equal to one another.
Dem.—Since the lines are equal, if AB be applied to CD, so that the point
A will coincide with C, and the line AB with CD, the point B shall coincide
with D; and because the segments are similar, they must coincide [xxiii.]. Hence
they are equal.
This demonstration may be stated as follows:—Since the chords are equal, they are congruent; and therefore the segments, being similar, must be congruent.
PROP. XXV.—Problem.
An arc (ABC) of a circle being given, it is required to describe the whole circle.
Sol.—Take any three points A, B, C in the arc. Join AB, BC. Bisect AB
in D, and BC in E. Erect DF, EF at right angles to AB, BC; then F, the
point of intersection, will be the centre of the circle.
Dem.—Because DF bisects the chord AB and
is perpendicular to it, it passes through the centre
[i., Cor. 1]. In like manner EF passes through the
centre. Hence the point F must be the centre; and
the circle described from F as centre, with F A as
radius, will be the circle required.
PROP. XXVI.—Theorem.
The four Propositions xxvi.–xxix. are so like in their enunciations that students frequently substitute one for another. The following scheme will assist in remembering them:—
In Proposition xxvi. are given angles =, to prove arcs =,
,, xxvii. ,, arcs =, ,, angles =,
,, xxviii. ,, chords =, ,, arcs =,
,, xxix. ,, arcs =, ,, chords =;
so that Proposition xxvii. is the converse of xxvi., and xxix. of xxviii.
In equal circles (ACB, DF E), equal angles at the centres (AOB, DHE) or at
the circumferences (ACB, DF E) stand upon equal arcs.
87
Dem.—1. Suppose the angles
at the centres to be given equal.
Now because the circles are equal
their radii are equal (Def. i.).
Therefore the two triangles AOB,
DHE have the sides AO, OB in
one respectively equal to the sides
DH, HE in the other, and the
angle AOB equal to DHE (hyp.).
Therefore [I. iv.] the base AB is equal to DE.
Again, since the angles ACB, DF E are [xx.] the halves of the equal angles
AOB, DHE, they are equal [I. Axiom vii.]. Therefore (Def. x.) the segments
ACB, DF E are similar, and their chords AB, DE have been proved equal;
therefore [xxiv.] the segments are equal. And taking these equals from the
whole circles, which are equal (hyp.), the remaining segments AGB, DKE are
equal. Hence the arcs AGB, DKE are equal.
2. The demonstration of this case is included in the foregoing.
Cor. 1.—If the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral be equal, one of its
diagonals must be a diameter of the circumscribed circle.
Cor. 2.—Parallel chords in a circle intercept equal arcs.
Cor. 3.—If two chords intersect at any point within a circle, the sum of
the opposite arcs which they intercept is equal to the arc which parallel chords
intersecting on the circumference intercept. 2. If they intersect without the
circle, the difference of the arcs they intercept is equal to the arc which parallel
chords intersecting on the circumference intercept.
Cor. 4.—If two chords intersect at right angles, the sum of the opposite arcs
which they intercept on the circle is a semicircle.
PROP. XXVII.—Theorem.
In equal circles (ACB, DF E), angles at the centres (AOB, DHE), or at
the circumferences (ACB, DF E), which stand on equal arcs (AB, DE), are
equal.
Dem.—If possible let one of
them, such as AOB, be greater
than the other, DHE; and suppose a part such as AOL to be
equal to DHE. Then since the
circles are equal, and the angles
AOL, DHE at the centres are
equal (hyp.), the arc AL is equal
to DE [xxvi.]; but AB is equal
to DE (hyp.). Hence AL is equal to AB—that is, a part equal to the whole,
which is absurd. Therefore the angle AOB is equal to DHE.
88
2. The angles at the circumference, being the halves of the central angles, are
therefore equal.
PROP. XXVIII.—Theorem.
In equal circles (ACB, DF E),
equal chords (AB, DE) divide the circumferences into arcs,
which are equal each to each—
that is, the lesser to the lesser,
and the greater to the greater.
Dem.—If the equal chords be
diameters, the Proposition is evident. If not, let O, H be the centres. Join AO, OB, DH, HE; then because the circles are equal their radii are
equal (Def. i.). Hence the two triangles AOB, DHE have the sides AO, OB
in one respectively equal to the sides DH, HE in the other, and the base AB
is equal to DE (hyp.). Therefore [I. viii.] the angle AOB is equal to DHE.
Hence the arc AGB is equal to DKE [xxvi.]; and since the whole circumference
AGBC is equal to the whole circumference DKEF, the remaining arc ACB is
equal to the remaining arc DF E.
Exercises.
1. The line joining the feet of perpendiculars from any point in the circumference of a
circle, on two diameters given in position, is given in magnitude.
2. If a line of given length slide between two lines given in position, the locus of the
intersection of perpendiculars to the given lines at its extremities is a circle. (This is the
converse of 1.)
PROP. XXIX.—Theorem.
In equal circles (ACB, DF E), equal arcs (AGB, DCK) are subtended by
equal chords.
Dem.—Let O, H be the centres (see last fig.). Join AO, OB, DH, HE;
then because the circles are equal, the angles AOB, DHE at the centres, which
stand on the equal arcs AGB, DKE, are equal [xxvii.]. Again, because the
triangles AOB, DHE have the two sides AO, OB in one respectively equal to
the two sides DH, HE in the other, and the angle AOB equal to the angle
DHE, the base AB of one is equal to the base DE of the other.
Observation.—Since the two circles in the four last Propositions are equal, they are congruent figures, and the truth of the Propositions is evident by superposition.
89
PROP. XXX.—Problem.
To bisect a given arc ACB.
Sol.—Draw the chord AB; bisect it in D; erect DC at right angles to AB,
meeting the arc in C; then the arc is bisected in C.
Dem.—Join AC, BC. Then the triangles
ADC, BDC have the side AD equal to DB
(const.), and DC common to both, and the angle ADC equal to the angle BDC, each being
right. Hence the base AC is equal to the base
BC. Therefore [xxviii.] the arc AC is equal to
the arc BC. Hence the arc AB is bisected in C.
Exercises.
1. ABCD is a semicircle whose diameter is AD; the chord BC produced meets AD
produced in E: prove that if CE is equal to the radius, the arc AB is equal to three times
CD.
2. The internal and the external bisectors of the vertical angle of a triangle inscribed in a
circle meet the circumference again in points equidistant from the extremities of the base.
3. If from A, one of the points of intersection of two given circles, two chords ACD, AC0D0
be drawn, cutting the circles in the points C, D; C0
, D0
, the triangles BCD, BC0D0
, formed
by joining these to the second point B of intersection of the circles, are equiangular.
4. If the vertical angle ACB of a triangle inscribed in a circle be bisected by a line CD,
which meets the circle again in D, and from D perpendiculars DE, DF be drawn to the sides,
one of which must be produced: prove that EA is equal to BF, and hence show that CE is
equal to half the sum of AC, BC.
PROP. XXXI.—Theorem.
In a circle—(1). The angle in a semicircle is a right angle. (2). The angle
in a segment greater than a semicircle is an acute angle. (3). The angle in a
segment less than a semicircle is an obtuse angle.
Dem.—(1). Let AB be the diameter, C
any point in the semicircle. Join AC, CB.
The angle ACB is a right angle.
For let O be the centre. Join OC, and
produce AC to F. Then because AO is equal
to OC, the angle ACO is equal to the angle OAC. In like manner, the angle OCB is
equal to CBO. Hence the angle ACB is equal
to the sum of the two angles BAC, CBA; but
[I. xxxii.] the angle F CB is equal to the sum
of the two interior angles BAC, CBA of the
triangle ABC. Hence the angle ACB is equal
to its adjacent angle F CB, and therefore it
is a right angle [I. Def. xiii.].
90
(2). Let the arc ACE be greater than a semicircle. Join CE. Then the angle
ACE is evidently less than ACB; but ACB is right; therefore ACE is acute.
(3). Let the arc ACD be less than a semicircle; then evidently, from (1), the
angle ACD is obtuse.
Cor. 1.—If a parallelogram be inscribed in a circle, its diagonals intersect at
the centre of the circle.
Cor. 2.—Find the centre of a circle by means of a carpenter’s square.
Cor. 3.—From a point outside a circle draw two tangents to the circle.
PROP. XXXII.—Theorem.
If a line (EF) be a tangent to a circle, and from the point of contact (A)
a chord (AC) be drawn cutting the circle, the angles made by this line with
the tangent are respectively equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the
circle.
Dem.—(1). If the chord passes through
the centre, the Proposition is evident, for the
angles are right angles; but if not, from the
point of contact A draw AB at right angles
to the tangent. Join BC. Then because EF
is a tangent to the circle, and AB is drawn
from the point of contact perpendicular to
EF, AB passes through this centre [xix.].
Therefore the angle ACB is right [xxxi.].
Hence the sum of the two remaining angles
ABC, CAB is one right angle; but the angle
BAF is right (const.); therefore the sum of the angles ABC, BAC is equal to
BAF. Reject BAC, which is common, and we get the angle ABC equal to the
angle F AC.
(2). Take any point D in the arc AC. It is required to prove that the angle
CAE is equal to CDA.
Since the quadrilateral ABCD is cyclic, the
sum of the opposite angles ABC, CDA is two
right angles [xxii.], and therefore equal to the
sum of the angles F AC, CAE; but the angles
ABC, F AC are equal (1). Reject them, and we
get the angle CDA equal to CAE.
Or thus: Take any point G in the semicircle AGB. Join AG, GB, GC. Then the
angle AGB = F AB, each being right, and
CGB = CAB [xxi.]. Therefore the remaining angle AGC = F AC. Again, join BD, CD.
The angle BDA = BAE, each being right, and
CDB = CAB [xxi.]. Hence the angle CDA = CAE.—Lardner.
91
Or by the method of limits, see Townsend’s
Modern Geometry, vol. i., page 14.
The angle BAC is equal to BDC [xxi.]. Now
let the point B move until it becomes consecutive
to A; then AB will be a tangent, and BD will
coincide with AD, and the angle BDC with ADC.
Hence, if AX be a tangent at A, AC any chord,
the angle which the tangent makes with the chord
is equal to the angle in the alternate segment.
Exercises.
1. If two circles touch, any line drawn through the point of contact will cut off similar
segments.
2. If two circles touch, and any two lines be drawn through the point of contact, cutting
both circles again, the chord connecting their points of intersection with one circle is parallel
to the chord connecting their points of intersection with the other circle.
3. ACB is an arc of a circle, CE a tangent at C, meeting the chord AB produced in E,
and AD a perpendicular to AB in D: prove, if DE be bisected in C, that the arc AC = 2CB.
4. If two circles touch at a point A, and ABC be a chord through A, meeting the circles
in B and C: prove that the tangents at B and C are parallel to each other, and that when one
circle is within the other, the tangent at B meets the outer circle in two points equidistant
from C.
5. If two circles touch externally, their common tangent at either side subtends a right
angle at the point of contact, and its square is equal to the rectangle contained by their
diameters.
PROP. XXXIII.—Problem.
On a given right line (AB) to describe a segment of a circle which shall
contain an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle (X).
Sol.—If X be a right angle, describe a semicircle on the given line, and the
thing required is done; for the angle in a semicircle is a right angle.
If not, make with the given line AB the angle BAE equal to X. Erect AC
at right angles to AE, and BC at right angles to AB. On AC as diameter
describe a circle: it will be the circle required.
92
Dem.—The circle on AC as diameter passes through B, since the angle
ABC is right [xxxi.] and touches AE, since the angle CAE is right [xvi.].
Therefore the angle BAE [xxxii.] is equal to the angle in the alternate segment;
but the angle BAE is equal to the angle X (const.). Therefore the angle X is
equal to the angle in the segment described on AB.
Exercises.
1. Construct a triangle, being given base, vertical angle, and any of the following data:—1.
Perpendicular. 2. The sum or difference of the sides. 3. Sum or difference of the squares of
the sides. 4. Side of the inscribed square on the base. 5. The median that bisects the base.

4. In the same case, find the loci of the angular points of a square described on one of the
sides.
PROP. XXXIV.—Problem.
To cut off from a given circle (ABC) a segment which shall contain an angle
equal to a given angle (X).
Sol.—Take any point A in the circumference. Draw the tangent AD, and make the
angle DAC equal to the given angle X. AC
will cut off the required segment.
Dem.—Take any point B in the alternate segment. Join BA, BC. Then the angle
DAC is equal to ABC [xxxii.]; but DAC
is equal to X (const.). Therefore the angle
ABC is equal to X.
PROP. XXXV.—Theorem.
If two chords (AB, CD) of a circle intersect in a point (E) within the circle,
the rectangles (AE . EB, CE . ED) contained by the segments are equal.
Dem.—1. If the point of intersection be the
centre, each rectangle is equal to the square of the
radius. Hence they are equal.
2. Let one of the chords AB pass through the
centre O, and cut the other chord CD, which does
not pass through the centre, at right angles. Join
OC. Now because AB passes through the centre,
and cuts the other chord CD, which does not pass
through the centre at right angles, it bisects it [iii.].
Again, because AB is divided equally in O and unequally in E, the rectangle
93
AE . EB, together with OE2
, is equal to OB2—that is, to OC2
[II. v.]; but
OC2
is equal to OE2 + EC2
[I. xlvii.] Therefore
AE . EB + OE2 = OE2 + EC2
.
Reject OE2
, which is common, and we have AE . EB = EC2
; but CE2
is equal
to the rectangle CE . ED, since CE is equal to ED. Therefore the rectangle
AE . EB is equal to the rectangle CE . ED.
3. Let AB pass through the centre, and cut CD,
which does not pass through the centre obliquely.
Let O be the centre. Draw OF perpendicular to
CD [I. xi.]. Join OC, OD. Then, since CD is cut at
right angles by OF, which passes through the centre,
it is bisected in F [iii.], and divided unequally in E.
Hence
CE . ED + F E2 = F D2
[II. v.],
and OF2 = OF2
.
Hence, adding, since F E2 + OF2 = OE2
[I. xlvii.], and F D2 + OF2 = OD2
,
we get
CE . ED + OE2 = OD or OB2
.
Again, since AB is bisected in O and divided unequally in E,
AE . EB + OE2 = OB2
[II. v.].
Therefore CE . ED + OE2 = AE . EB + OE2
.
Hence CE . ED = AE . EB.
4. Let neither chord pass through the centre.
Through the point E, where they intersect, draw
the diameter F G. Then by 3, the rectangle F E . EG
is equal to the rectangle AE . EB, and also to the
rectangle CE . ED. Hence the rectangle AE . EB is
equal to the rectangle CE . ED.
Cor. 1.—If a chord of a circle be divided in any
point within the circle, the rectangle contained by
its segments is equal to the difference between the
square of the radius and the square of the line drawn
from the centre to the point of section.
Cor. 2.—If the rectangle contained by the segments of one of two intersecting
lines be equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the other, the four
extremities are concyclic.
Cor. 3.—If two triangles be equiangular, the rectangle contained by the noncorresponding sides about any two equal angles are equal.
94
Let ABO, DCO be the equiangular triangles, and
let them be placed so that the equal angles at O may
be vertically opposite, and that the non-corresponding
sides AO, CO may be in one line; then the noncorresponding sides BO, OD shall be in one line. Now,
since the angle ABD is equal to ACD, the points A, B,
C, D are concyclic [xxi., Cor. 1]. Hence the rectangle
AO . OC is equal to the rectangle BO . OD [xxxv.].
Exercises.
1. In any triangle, the rectangle contained by two sides is equal to the rectangle contained
by the perpendicular on the third side and the diameter of the circumscribed circle.
Def.—The supplement of an arc is the difference between it and a semicircle.
2. The rectangle contained by the chord of an arc and the chord of its supplement is equal
to the rectangle contained by the radius and the chord of twice the supplement.
3. If the base of a triangle be given, and the sum of the sides, the rectangle contained by
the perpendiculars from the extremities of the base on the external bisector of the vertical
angle is given.
4. If the base and the difference of the sides be given, the rectangle contained by the
perpendiculars from the extremities of the base on the internal bisector is given.
5. Through one of the points of intersection of two circles draw a secant, so that the
rectangle contained by the intercepted chords may be given, or a maximum.
6. If the sum of two arcs, AC, CB of a circle
be less than a semicircle, the rectangle AC . CB contained by their chords is equal to the rectangle contained by the radius, and the excess of the chord of
the supplement of their difference above the chord of
the supplement of their sum.—Catalan.
Dem.—Draw DE, the diameter which is perpendicular to AB, and draw the chords CF, BG parallel to DE. Now it is evident that the difference between the arcs AC, CB is equal to 2CD, and therefore
= CD +EF. Hence the arc CBF is the supplement of
the difference, and CF is the chord of that supplement.
Again, since the angle ABG is right, the arc ABG is a
semicircle. Hence BG is the supplement of the sum of
the arcs AC, CB; therefore the line BG is the chord of
the supplement of the sum. Now (Ex. 1), the rectangle
AC . CB is equal to the rectangle contained by the diameter and CI, and therefore equal to
the rectangle contained by the radius and 2CI; but the difference between CF and BG is
evidently equal to 2CI. Hence the rectangle AC . CB is equal to the rectangle contained by
the radius and the difference between the chords CF, BG.
7. If we join AF, BF we find, as before, the rectangle AF . F B equal to the rectangle
contained by the radius and 2F I—that is, equal to the rectangle contained by the radius
and the sum of CF and BG. Hence—If the sum of two arcs of a circle be greater than a
semicircle, the rectangle contained by their chords is equal to the rectangle contained by the
radius, and the sum of the chords of the supplements of their sum and their difference.
8. Through a given point draw a transversal cutting two lines given in position, so that
the rectangle contained by the segments intercepted between it and the line may be given.
95
PROP. XXXVI.—Theorem.
If from any point (P) without a circle two lines be drawn to it, one of which
(P T) is a tangent, and the other (P A) a secant, the rectangle (AP, BP) contained by the segments of the secant is equal to the square of the tangent.
Dem.—1. Let P A pass through the
centre O. Join OT. Then because AB
is bisected in O and divided externally
in P, the rectangle AP . BP + OB2
is
equal to OP2
[II. vi.]. But since P T is a
tangent, and OT drawn from the centre
to the point of contact, the angle OT P is
right [xviii.]. Hence OT2 +P T2
is equal
to OP2
.
Therefore AP . BP + OB2 = OT2 + P T2
;
but OB2 = OT2
.
Hence the rectangle AP . BP = P T2
.
2. If AB does not pass through the
centre O, let fall the perpendicular OC
on AB. Join OT, OB, OP. Then because OC, a line through the centre,
cuts AB, which does not pass through
the centre at right angles, it bisects it
[iii.]. Hence, since AB is bisected in C
and divided externally in P, the rectangle
AP . BP + CB2 = CP2
[II. vi.];
and OC2 = OC2
.
Hence, adding, since CB2 + OC2 = OB2
[I. xlvii.], and CP2 + OC2 = OP2
,
we get
rectangle AP . BP + OB2 = OP2
;
but OT2 + P T2 = OP2
[I. xlvii.].
Therefore AP . BP + OB2 = OT2 + P T2
;
and rejecting the equals OB2 and OT2
, we have the rectangle
AP . BP = P T2
.
The two Propositions xxxv., xxxvi., may be included in one enunciation, as follows:—The
rectangle AP . BP contained by the segments of any chord of a given circle passing through
a fixed point P, either within or without the circle, is constant. For let O be the centre: join
96
OA, OB, OP. Then OAB is an isosceles triangle, and OP is a line drawn from its vertex to a
point P in the base, or base produced. Then the rectangle AP . BP is equal to the difference
of the squares of OB and OP, and is therefore constant.
Cor. 1.—If two lines AB, CD produced meet in P, and if the rectangle
AP . BP = CP . DP, the points A, B, C, D are concyclic (compare xxxv.,
Cor. 2).
Cor. 2.—Tangents to two circles from any point in their common chord are
equal (compare xvii., Ex. 6).
Cor. 3.—The common chords of any three intersecting circles are concurrent
(compare xvii., Ex. 7).
Exercise.
If from the vertex A of a 4 ABC, AD be drawn, meeting CB produced in D, and making
the angle BAD = ACB, prove DB . DC = DA2
.
PROP. XXXVII.—Theorem.
If the rectangle (AP . BP) contained by the segments of a secant, drawn from
any point (P) without a circle, be equal to the square of a line (P T) drawn from
the same point to meet the circle, the line which meets the circle is a tangent.
Dem.—From P draw P Q touching the circle [xvii.]. Let O be the
centre. Join OP, OQ, OT. Now
the rectangle AP . BP is equal to the
square on P T (hyp.), and equal to
the square on P Q [xxxvi.]. Hence
P T2
is equal to P Q2
, and therefore
P T is equal to P Q. Again, the triangles OT P, OQP have the side OT
equal OQ, T P equal QP, and the
base OP common; hence [I. viii.] the angle OT P is equal to OQP; but OQP is
a right angle, since P Q is a tangent [xviii.]; hence OT P is right, and therefore
[xvi.] P T is a tangent.

INSCRIPTION AND CIRCUMSCRIPTION OF TRIANGLES
AND OF REGULAR POLYGONS IN AND ABOUT CIRCLES
DEFINITIONS.
i. If two rectilineal figures be so related that the angular points of one lie
on the sides of the other—1, the former is said to be inscribed in the latter; 2,
the latter is said to be described about the former.
ii. A rectilineal figure is said to be inscribed in a circle when its angular
points are on the circumference. Reciprocally, a rectilineal figure is said to be
circumscribed to a circle when each side touches the circle.
iii. A circle is said to be inscribed in a rectilineal figure when it touches

rectilineal figure when it passes through each angular point of the figure.
iv. A rectilineal figure which is both equilateral and equiangular is said to
be regular.
Observation.—The following summary of the contents of the Fourth Book will assist the
student in remembering it:—
1. It contains sixteen Propositions, of which four relate to triangles, four to squares, four
to pentagons, and four miscellaneous Propositions.
2. Of the four Propositions occupied with triangles—
(?) One is to inscribe a triangle in a circle.
(?) Its reciprocal, to describe a triangle about a circle.
(?) To inscribe a circle in a triangle.
(?) Its reciprocal, to describe a circle about a triangle.
3. If we substitute in (?), (?), (?), (?) squares for triangles, and pentagons for triangles,
we have the problems for squares and pentagons respectively.
4. Every Proposition in the fourth Book is a problem.
PROP. I.—Problem.
In a given circle (ABC) to place a chord equal to a given line (D) not greater
than the diameter.
Sol.—Draw any diameter AC of
the circle; then, if AC be equal to
D, the thing required is done; if not,
from AC cut off the part AE equal
to D [I. iii.]; and with A as centre
and AE as radius, describe the circle EBF, cutting the circle ABC in
the points B, F. Join AB. Then
AB is the chord required.
101
Dem.—Because A is the centre of the circle EBF, AB is equal to AE
[I. Def. xxxii.]; but AE is equal to D (const.); therefore AB is equal to D.
PROP. II.—Problem.
In a given circle (ABC) to inscribe a triangle equiangular to a given triangle
(DEF).
Sol.—Take any point A in the circumference, and at it draw the tangent GH; then make the angle HAC
equal to E, and GAB equal to F
[I. xxiii.] Join BC. ABC is a triangle fulfilling the required conditions.
Dem.—The angle E is equal to
HAC (const.), and HAC is equal to
the angle ABC in the alternate segment [III. xxxii.]. Hence the angle E is equal to ABC. In like manner the
angle F is equal to ACB. Therefore [I. xxxii.] the remaining angle D is equal
to BAC. Hence the triangle ABC inscribed in the given circle is equiangular to
DEF.
PROP. III.—Problem.
About a given circle (ABC) to describe a triangle equiangular to a given
triangle (DEF).
Sol.—Produce any side DE of the given triangle both ways to G and H,
and from the centre O of the circle draw any radius OA; make the angle AOB
equal to GEF [I. xxiii.], and the angle AOC equal to HDF. At the points A,
B, C draw the tangents LM, MN, NL to the given circle. LMN is a triangle
fulfilling the required conditions.
102
Dem.—Because AM touches the circle at A, the angle OAM is right. In
like manner, the angle MBO is right; but the sum of the four angles of the
quadrilateral OAMB is equal to four right angles. Therefore the sum of the
two remaining angles AOB, AMB is two right angles; and [I. xiii.] the sum
of the two angles GEF, F ED is two right angles. Therefore the sum of AOB,
AMB is equal to the sum of GEF, F ED; but AOB is equal to GEF (const.).
Hence AMB is equal to F ED. In like manner, ALC is equal to EDF; therefore
[I. xxxii.] the remaining angle BNC is equal to DF E. Hence the triangle LMN
is equiangular to DEF.
PROP. IV.—Problem.
To inscribe a circle in a given triangle (ABC).
Sol.—Bisect any two angles A, B of the given triangle by the lines AO, BO;
then O, their point of intersection, is the centre of the required circle.
Dem.—From O let fall the perpendiculars
OD, OE, OF on the sides of the triangle. Now,
in the triangles OAE, OAF the angle OAE is
equal to OAF (const.), and the angle AEO equal
to AF O, because each is right, and the side OA
common. Hence [I. xxvi.] the side OE is equal
to OF. In like manner OD is equal to OF; therefore the three lines OD, OE, OF are all equal.
And the circle described with O as centre and
OD as radius will pass through the points E, F;
and since the angles D, E, F are right, it will
[III. xvi.] touch the three sides of the triangle ABC; and therefore the circle
DEF is inscribed in the triangle ABC.
Exercises.
1. If the points O, C be joined, the angle C
is bisected. Hence “the bisectors of the angles
of a triangle are concurrent” (compare I. xxvi.,
Ex. 7).
2. If the sides BC, CA, AB of the triangle
ABC be denoted by a, b, c, and half their sum by
s, the distances of the vertices A, B, C of the triangle from the points of contact of the inscribed
circle are respectively s ? a, s ? b, s ? c.
3. If the external angles of the triangle ABC
be bisected as in the annexed diagram, the three
angular points O0
, O00
, O000, of the triangle
formed by the three bisectors will be the centres
of three circles, each touching one side externally,
and the other two produced. These three circles are called the escribed circles of the triangle
ABC.
4. The distances of the vertices A, B, C from
the points of contact of the escribed circle which
touches AB externally are s ? b, s ? a, s.
103
5. The centre of the inscribed circle, the centre of each escribed circle, and two of the
angular points of the triangle, are concyclic. Also any two of the escribed centres are concyclic
with the corresponding two of the angular points of the triangle.
6. Of the four points O, O0
, O00
, O000, any one is the orthocentre of the triangle formed
by the remaining three.
7. The three triangles BCO0
, CAO00
, ABO000 are equiangular.
8. The rectangle CO . CO000 = ab; AO . AO0 = bc; BO . BO00 = ca.
9. Since the whole triangle ABC is made up of the three triangles AOB, BOC, COA, we
see that the rectangle contained by the sum of the three sides, and the radius of the inscribed
circle, is equal to twice the area of the triangle. Hence, if r denote the radius of the inscribed
circle, rs = area of the triangle.
10. If r
0 denote the radius of the escribed circle which touches the side a externally, it
may be shown in like manner that r
0
(s ? a) = area of the triangle.
11. rr0 = s ? b . s ? c.
12. Square of area = s . s ? a . s ? b . s ? c.
13. Square of area = r . r0
. r00 . r000
.
14. If the triangle ABC be right-angled, having the angle C right,
r = s ? c; r
0 = s ? b; r
00 = s ? a; r
000 = s.
15. Given the base of a triangle, the vertical angle, and the radius of the inscribed, or any
of the escribed circles: construct it.
PROP. V.—Problem.
To describe a circle about a given triangle (ABC).
Sol.—Bisect any two sides BC, AC in the points
D, E. Erect DO, EO at right angles to BC, CA;
then O, the point of intersection of the perpendiculars, is the centre of the required circle.
Dem.—Join OA, OB, OC. The triangles BDO,
CDO have the side BD equal CD (const.), and DO
common, and the angle BDO equal to the angle
CDO, because each is right. Hence [I. iv.] BO is
equal to OC. In like manner AO is equal to OC.
Therefore the three lines AO, BO, CO are equal,
and the circle described with O as centre, and OA as radius, will pass through
the points A, B, C, and be described about the triangle ABC.
Cor. 1.—Since the perpendicular from O on AB bisects it [III. iii.], we
see that the perpendiculars at the middle points of the sides of a triangle are
concurrent.
Def.—The circle ABC is called the circumcircle, its radius the circumradius, and its centre the circumcentre of the triangle.
Exercises.
1. The three perpendiculars of a triangle (ABC) are concurrent.
104
Dem.—Describe a circle about the triangle. Let fall the
perpendicular CF. Produce CF to meet the circle in G. Make
F O = F G. Join AG, AO. Produce AO to meet BC in D.
Then the triangles GF A, OF A have the sides GF, F A in one
equal to the sides OF, F A in the other, and the contained
angles equal. Hence [I. iv.] the angle GAF equal OAF; but
GAF = GCB [III. xxi.]; hence OAF = OCD, and F OA =
DOC; hence OF A = ODC; but OF A is right, hence ODC is
right. In like manner, if BO be joined to meet AC in E, BE
will be perpendicular to AC. Hence the three perpendiculars
pass through O, and are concurrent. This Proposition may be proved simply as follows:—
Draw parallels to the sides of the original triangle ABC through its vertices, forming a new
triangle A0B0C0 described about ABC; then the
three perpendiculars at the middle points of the
sides of A0B0C0 are concurrent [v. Cor. 1], and
these are evidently the perpendiculars from the
vertices on the opposite sides of the triangle ABC
(compare Ex. 16, Book I.).
Def.—The point O is called the orthocentre of
the triangle ABC.
2. The three rectangles OA . OP, OB . OQ,
OC . OR are equal.
Def.—The circle round O as centre, the
square of whose radius is equal OA . OP = OB . OQ = OC . OR, is called the polar circle
of the triangle ABC.
Observation.—If the orthocentre of the triangle ABC be within the triangle, the rectangles
OA . OP, OB . OQ, OC . OR are negative, because the lines OA . OP, &c., are measured in
opposite directions, and have contrary signs; hence the polar circle is imaginary; but it is real
when the point O is without the triangle—that is, when the triangle has an obtuse angle.
3. If the perpendiculars of a triangle be produced to meet the circumscribed circle, the
intercepts between the orthocentre and the circle are bisected by the sides of the triangle.
4. The point of bisection (I) of the line (OP)
joining the orthocentre (O) to the circumference (P)
of any triangle is equally distant from the feet of the
perpendiculars, from the middle points of the sides,
and from the middle points of the distances of the
vertices from the orthocentre.
Dem.—Draw the perpendicular P H; then,
since OF, P H are perpendiculars on AB, and OP is
bisected in I, it is easy to see that IH = IF. Again,
since OP, OG are bisected in I, F; IF = 1
2
P G—
that is, IF = 1
2
the radius. Hence the distance of I
from the foot of each perpendicular, and from the
middle point of each side, is = 1
2
the radius. In like
manner, if OC be bisected in K, then IK = 1
2
the
radius. Hence we have the following theorem:—The
nine points made up of the feet of the perpendiculars, the middle points of the sides, and the middle points of the lines from the vertices to
the orthocentre, are concyclic.
Def.—The circle through these nine points is called the “nine points circle” of the triangle.
5. The circumcircle of a triangle is the “nine points circle” of each of the four triangles
formed by joining the centres of the inscribed and escribed circles.
6. The distances between the vertices of a triangle and its orthocentre are respectively the
doubles of the perpendiculars from the circumcentre on the sides.
7. The radius of the “nine points circle” of a triangle is equal to half its circumradius.
105
PROP. VI.—Problem.
In a given circle (ABCD) to inscribe a square.
Sol.—Draw any two diameters AC, BD at
right angles to each other. Join AB, BC, CD,
DA. ABCD is a square.
Dem.—Let O be the centre. Then the
four angles at O, being right angles, are equal.
Hence the arcs on which they stand are equal
[III. xxvi.], and hence the four chords are equal
[III. xxix.]. Therefore the figure ABCD is equilateral.
Again, because AC is a diameter, the angle
ABC is right [III. xxxi.]. In like manner the remaining angles are right. Hence
ABCD is a square.
PROP. VII.—Problem.
About a given circle (ABCD) to describe a square.
Sol.—Through the centre O draw any two diameters at right angles to each
other, and draw at the points A, B, C, D the lines HE, EF, F G, GH touching
the circle. EF GH is a square.
Dem.—Because AE touches the circle at A,
the angle EAO is right [III. xviii.], and therefore
equal to BOC, which is right (const.). Hence AE
is parallel to OB. In like manner EB is parallel
to AO; and since AO is equal to OB, the figure
AOBE is a lozenge, and the angle AOB is right;
hence AOBE is a square. In like manner each of
the figures BC, CD, DA is a square. Hence the
whole figure is a square.
Cor.—The circumscribed square is double of
the inscribed square.
PROP. VIII.—Problem.
In a given square (ABCD) to inscribe a circle.
Sol.—Bisect (see last diagram) two adjacent sides EH, EF in the points A,
B, and through A, B draw the lines AC, BD, respectively parallel to EF, EH;
then O, the point of intersection of these parallels, is the centre of the required
circle.
Dem.—Because AOBE is a parallelogram, its opposite sides are equal;
therefore AO is equal to EB; but EB is half the side of the given square;
106
therefore AO is equal to half the side of the given square; and so in like manner
is each of the lines OB, OC, OD; therefore the four lines OA, OB, OC, OD
are all equal; and since they are perpendicular to the sides of the given square,
the circle described with O as centre, and OA as radius, will be inscribed in the
square.
PROP. IX.—Problem.
About a given square (ABCD) to describe a circle.
Sol.—Draw the diagonals AC, BD intersecting in O (see diagram to Proposition vi.). O is the centre of the required circle.
Dem.—Since ABC is an isosceles triangle, and the angle B is right, each
of the other angles is half a right angle; therefore BAO is half a right angle.
In like manner ABO is half a right angle; hence the angle BAO equal ABO;
therefore [I. vi.] AO is equal to OB. In like manner OB is equal to OC, and
OC to OD. Hence the circle described, with O as centre and OA as radius, will
pass through the points B, C, D, and be described about the square.
PROP. X.—Problem.
To construct an isosceles triangle having each base angle double the vertical
angle.
Sol.—Take any line AB. Divide it in C,
so that the rectangle AB . BC shall be equal to
AC2
[II. xi.]. With A as centre, and AB as
radius, describe the circle BDE, and in it place
the chord BD equal to AC [i.]. Join AD. ADB
is a triangle fulfilling the required conditions.
Dem.—Join CD. About the triangle ACD
describe the circle CDE [v.]. Then, because
the rectangle AB . BC is equal to AC2
(const.),
and that AC is equal to BD (const.); therefore
the rectangle AB . BC is equal to BD2
. Hence
[III. xxxii.] BD touches the circle ACD. Hence the angle BDC is equal to the
angle A in the alternate segment [III. xxxii.]. To each add CDA, and we have
the angle BDA equal to the sum of the angles CDA and A; but the exterior
angle BCD of the triangle ACD is equal to the sum of the angles CDA and
A. Hence the angle BDA is equal to BCD; but since AB is equal to AD, the
angle BDA is equal to ABD; therefore the angle CBD is equal to BCD. Hence
[I. vi.] BD is equal to CD; but BD is equal to AC (const.); therefore AC is
equal to CD, and therefore [I. v.] the angle CDA is equal to A; but BDA has
been proved to be equal to the sum of CDA and A. Hence BDA is double of
A. Hence each of the base angles of the triangle ABD is double of the vertical
angle.
107
Exercises.
1. Prove that ACD is an isosceles triangle whose vertical angle is equal to three times
each of the base angles.
2. Prove that BD is the side of a regular decagon inscribed in the circle BDE.
3. If DB, DE, EF be consecutive sides of a regular decagon inscribed in a circle, prove
BF ? BD = radius of circle.
4. If E be the second point of intersection of the circle ACD with BDE, DE is equal to
DB; and if AE, BE, CE, DE be joined, each of the triangles ACE, ADE is congruent with
ABD.
5. AC is the side of a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle ACD, and EB the side of
a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle BDE.
6. Since ACE is an isosceles triangle, EB2 ? EA2 = AB . BC—that is = BD2
; therefore
EB2 ?BD2 = EA2—that is, the square of the side of a pentagon inscribed in a circle exceeds
the square of the side of the decagon inscribed in the same circle by the square of the radius.
PROP. XI.—Problem.
To inscribe a regular pentagon in a given circle (ABCDE).
Sol.—Construct an isosceles triangle [x.],
having each base angle double the vertical angle, and inscribe in the given circle a triangle
ABD equiangular to it. Bisect the angles DAB,
ABD by the lines AC, BE. Join EA, ED, DC,
CB; then the figure ABCDE is a regular pentagon.
Dem.—Because each of the base angles
BAD, ABD is double of the angle ADB, and
the lines AC, BE bisect them, the five angles
BAC, CAD, ADB, DBE, EBA are all equal;
therefore the arcs on which they stand are equal; and therefore the five chords,
AB, BC, CD, DE, EA are equal. Hence the figure ABCDE is equilateral.
Again, because the arcs AB, DE are equal, adding the arc BCD to both,
the arc ABCD is equal to the arc BCDE, and therefore [III. xxvii.] the angles
AED, BAE, which stand on them, are equal. In the same manner it can be
proved that all the angles are equal; therefore the figure ABCDE is equiangular.
Hence it is a regular pentagon.
Exercises.
1. The figure formed by the five diagonals of a regular pentagon is another regular pentagon.
2. If the alternate sides of a regular pentagon be produced to meet, the five points of
meeting form another regular pentagon.
3. Every two consecutive diagonals of a regular pentagon divide each other in extreme
and mean ratio.
4. Being given a side of a regular pentagon, construct it.
5. Divide a right angle into five equal parts.
108
PROP. XII.—Problem.
To describe a regular pentagon about a given circle (ABCDE).
Sol.—Let the five points A, B, C, D, E on the circle be the vertices of any
inscribed regular pentagon: at these points draw tangents F G, GH, HI, IJ,
JF: the figure F GHIJ is a circumscribed regular pentagon.
Dem.—Let O be the centre of the circle. Join OE, OA, OB. Now, because the
angles A, E of the quadrilateral AOEF are
right angles [III. xviii.], the sum of the two
remaining angles AOE, AF E is two right angles. In like manner the sum of the angles
AOB, AGB is two right angles; therefore the
sum of AOE, AF E is equal to the sum of
AOB, AGB; but the angles AOE, AOB are
equal, because they stand on equal arcs AE,
AB [III. xxvii.]. Hence the angle AF E is
equal to AGB. In like manner the remaining
angles of the figure F GHIJ are equal. Therefore it is equiangular.
Again, join OF, OG. Now the triangles EOF, AOF have the sides AF, F E
equal [III. xvii., Ex. 1], and F O common, and the base AO equal to the base
EO. Hence the angle AF O is equal to EF O [I. viii.]. Therefore the angle AF O
is half the angle AF E. In like manner AGO is half the angle AGB; but AF E
has been proved equal to AGB; hence AF O is equal to AGO, and F AO is equal
to GAO, each being right, and AO common to the two triangles F AO, GAO;
hence [I. xxvi.] the side AF is equal to AG; therefore GF is double AF. In like
manner JF is double EF; but AF is equal to EF; hence GF is equal to JF.
In like manner the remaining sides are equal; therefore the figure F GHIJ is
equilateral, and it has been proved equiangular. Hence it is a regular pentagon.
This Proposition is a particular case of the following general theorem, of which the proof
is the same as the foregoing:—
“If tangents be drawn to a circle, at the angular points of an inscribed polygon of any
number of sides, they will form a regular polygon of the same number of sides circumscribed
to the circle.”
PROP. XIII.—Problem.
To inscribe a circle in a regular pentagon (ABCDE).
Sol.—Bisect two adjacent angles A, B by the lines AO, BO; then O, the
point of intersection of the bisectors, is the centre of the required circle.
Dem.—Join CO, and let fall perpendiculars from O on the five sides of the
pentagon. Now the triangles ABO, CBO have the side AB equal to BC (hyp.),
and BO common, and the angle ABO equal to CBO (const.). Hence the angle
BAO is equal to BCO [I. iv.]; but BAO is half BAE (const.). Therefore BCO
is half BCD, and therefore CO bisects the angle BCD. In like manner it may
be proved that DO bisects the angle D, and EO the angle E.
109
Again, the triangles BOF, BOG have the
angle F equal to G, each being right; and
OBF equal to OBG, because OB bisects the
angle ABC (const.), and OB common; hence
[I. xxvi.] OF is equal to OG. In like manner
all the perpendiculars from O on the sides of
the pentagon are equal; hence the circle whose
centre is O, and radius OF, will touch all the
sides of the pentagon, and will therefore be inscribed in it.
In the same manner a circle may be inscribed in any regular polygon.
PROP. XIV.—Problem.
To describe a circle about a regular pentagon (ABCDE).
Sol.—Bisect two adjacent angles A, B by the lines AO, BO. Then O, the
point of intersection of the bisectors, is the centre of the required circle.
Dem.—Join OC, OD, OE. Then the triangles
ABO, CBO have the side AB equal to BC (hyp.),
BO common, and the angle ABO equal to CBO
(const.). Hence the angle BAO is equal to BCO
[I. iv.]; but the angle BAE is equal to BCD (hyp.);
and since BAO is half BAE (const.), BCO is half
BCD. Hence CO bisects the angle BCD. In like
manner it may be proved that DO bisects CDE,
and EO the angle DEA. Again, because the angle
EAB is equal to ABC, their halves are equal. Hence
OAB is equal to OBA; therefore [I. vi.] OA is equal to OB. In like manner the
lines OC, OD, OE are equal to one another and to OA. Therefore the circle
described with O as centre, and OA as radius, will pass through the points B,
C, D, E, and be described about the pentagon.
In the same manner a circle may be described about any regular polygon.
Propositions xiii., xiv. are particular cases of the following theorem:—
“A regular polygon of any number of sides has one circle inscribed in it, and another
described about it, and both circles are concentric.”
PROP. XV.—Problem.
In a given circle (ABCDEF) to inscribe a regular hexagon.
Sol.—Take any point A in the circumference, and join it to O, the centre
of the given circle; then with A as centre, and AO as radius, describe the circle
OBF, intersecting the given circle in the points B, F. Join OB, OF, and
produce AO, BO, F O to meet the given circle again in the points D, E, C.
Join AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, F A; ABCDEF is the required hexagon.
110
Dem.—Each of the triangles AOB,
AOF is equilateral (see Dem., I. i.).
Hence the angles AOB, AOF are each
one-third of two right angles; therefore
EOF is one-third of two right angles.
Again, the angles BOC, COD, DOE are
[I. xv.] respectively equal to the angles
EOF, F OA, AOB. Therefore the six angles at the centre are equal, because each is one-third of two right angles. Therefore the six chords are equal [III. xxix.]. Hence the hexagon is equilateral.
Again, since the arc AF is equal to ED, to each add the arc ABCD; then
the whole arc F ABCD is equal to ABCDE; therefore the angles DEF, EF A
which stand on these arcs are equal [III. xxvii.]. In the same manner it may be
shown that the other angles of the hexagon are equal. Hence it is equiangular,
and is therefore a regular hexagon inscribed in the circle.
Cor. 1.—The side of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle is equal to the
radius.
Cor. 2.—If three alternate angles of a hexagon be joined, they form an
inscribed equilateral triangle.
Exercises.
1. The area of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle is equal to twice the area of an
equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle; and the square of the side of the triangle is three
times the square of the side of the hexagon.
2. If the diameter of a circle be produced to C until the produced part is equal to the
radius, the two tangents from C and their chord of contact form an equilateral triangle.
3. The area of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle is half the area of an equilateral
triangle, and three-fourths of the area of a regular hexagon circumscribed to the circle.
PROP. XVI.—Problem.
To inscribe a regular polygon of fifteen sides in a given circle.
Sol.—Inscribe a regular pentagon ABCDE in the circle [xi.], and also an
equilateral triangle AGH [ii.]. Join CG. CG is a side of the required polygon.
Dem.—Since ABCDE is a regular pentagon,
the arc ABC is 2
5
ths of the circumference; and since
AGH is an equilateral triangle, the arc ABG is 1
3
rd
of the circumference. Hence the arc GC, which is
the difference between these two arcs, is equal to
2
5
ths ?
1
3
rd, or 1
15 th of the entire circumference; and
therefore, if chords equal to GC [i.] be placed round
the circle, we shall have a regular polygon of fifteen
sides, or quindecagon, inscribed in it.
Scholium.—Until the year 1801 no regular polygon could be described by constructions
employing the line and circle only, except those discussed in this Book, and those obtained
from them by the continued bisection of the arcs of which their sides are the chords; but in
111
that year the celebrated Gauss proved that if 2n + 1 be a prime number, regular polygons of
2
n + 1 sides are inscriptable by elementary geometry. For the case n = 4, which is the only
figure of this class except the pentagon for which a construction has been given, see Note at
the end of this work.

BOOK V.
THEORY OF PROPORTION
DEFINITIONS.
Introduction.—Every proposition in the theories of ratio and proportion is
true for all descriptions of magnitude. Hence it follows that the proper treatment
is the Algebraic. It is, at all events, the easiest and the most satisfactory.
Euclid’s proofs of the propositions, in the Theory of Proportion, possess at
present none but a historical interest, as no student reads them now. But
although his demonstrations are abandoned, his propositions are quoted by
every writer, and his nomenclature is universally adopted. For these reasons
it appears to us that the best method is to state Euclid’s definitions, explain
them, or prove them when necessary, for some are theorems under the guise of
definitions, and then supply simple algebraic proofs of his propositions.
i. A less magnitude is said to be a part or submultiple of a greater magnitude,
when the less measures the greater—that is, when the less is contained a certain
number of times exactly in the greater.
ii. A greater magnitude is said to be a multiple of a less when the greater
is measured by the less—that is, when the greater contains the less a certain
number of times exactly.
iii. Ratio is the mutual relation of two magnitudes of the same kind with
respect to quantity.
iv. Magnitudes are said to have a ratio to one another when the less can be
multiplied so as to exceed the greater.
These definitions require explanation, especially Def. iii., which has the fault
of conveying no precise meaning—being, in fact, unintelligible.
The following annotations will make them explicit:—
1. If an integer be divided into any number
of equal parts, one, or the sum of any number of
these parts, is called a fraction. Thus, if the line AB represent the integer, and if it be divided
into four equal parts in the points C, D, E, then AC is 1
4
; AD,
2
4
; AE,
3
4
. Thus, a fraction
is denoted by two numbers parted by a horizontal line; the lower, called the denominator,
denotes the number of equal parts into which the integer is divided; and the upper, called
the numerator, denotes the number of these equal parts which are taken. Hence it follows,
that if the numerator be less than the denominator, the fraction is less than unity. If the
numerator be equal to the denominator, the fraction is equal to unity; and if greater than the
denominator, it is greater than unity. It is evident that a fraction is an abstract quantity—that
is, that its value is independent of the nature of the integer which is divided.
2. If we divide each of the equal parts AC, CD, DE, EB into two equal parts, the whole,
AB, will be divided into eight equal parts; and we see that AC = 2
8
; AD = 4
8
; AE = 6
8
;
AB = 8
8
; Now, we saw in 1, that AE = 3
4
of the integer, and we have just shown that it is
equal to 6
8
. Hence 3
4 = 6
8
; but 6
8
would be got from 3
4
by multiplying its terms (numerator
and denominator) by 2. Hence we infer generally that multiplying the terms of any fraction
by 2 does not alter its value. In like manner it may be shown that multiplying the terms of
116
a fraction by any whole number does not alter its value. Hence it follows conversely, that
dividing the terms of a fraction by a whole number does not alter the value. Hence we have
the following important and fundamental theorem:—Two transformations can be made on
any fraction without changing its value; namely, its terms can be either multiplied or divided
by any whole number, and in either case the value of the new fraction is equal to the value
of the original one.
3. If we take any number, such as 3, and multiply it by any whole number, the product is
called a multiple of 3. Thus 6, 9, 12, 15, &c., are multiples of 3; but 10, 13, 17, &c., are not,
because the multiplication of 3 by any whole number will not produce them. Conversely, 3 is
a submultiple, or measure, or part of 6, 9, 12, 15, &c., because it is contained in each of these
without a remainder; but not of 10, 13, 17, &c., because in each case it leaves a remainder.
4. If we consider two magnitudes of the same
kind, such as two lines AB, CD, and if we suppose that AB is equal to 3
4
of CD, it is evident, if
AB be divided into 3 equal parts, and CD into 4
equal parts, that one of the parts into which AB
is divided is equal to one of the parts into which
CD is divided. And as there are 3 parts in AB, and 4 in CD, we express this relation by
saying that AB has to CD the ratio of 3 to 4; and we denote it thus, 3 : 4. Hence the ratio
3 : 4 expresses the same idea as the fraction 3
4
. In fact, both are different ways of expressing
and writing the same thing. When written 3 : 4 it is called a ratio, and when 3
4
a fraction.
In the same manner it can be shown that every ratio whose terms are commensurable can be
converted into a fraction; and, conversely, every fraction can be turned into a ratio.
From this explanation we see that the ratio of any two commensurable magnitudes is
the same as the ratio of the numerical quantities which denote these magnitudes. Thus, the
ratio of two commensurable lines is the ratio of the numbers which express their lengths,
measured with the same unit. And this may be extended to the case where the lines are
incommensurable. Thus, if a be the side and b the diagonal of a square, the ratio of a : b is
a
b
, or
1
?
2
.
When two quantities are incommensurable, such as the diagonal and the side of a square,
although their ratio is not equal to that of any two commensurable numbers, yet a series
of pairs of fractions can be found whose difference is continually diminishing, and which
ultimately becomes indefinitely small; such that the ratio of the incommensurable quantities
is greater than one, and less than the other fraction of each pair. These fractions are called
convergents. By their means we can approximate as nearly as we please to the exact value of
the ratio. In the case of the diagonal and the side of a square, the following are the pairs of
convergents:—
14
10
,
15
10
;
141
100
,
142
100
;
1414
1000
,
1415
1000
; &c.,
and the ratio is intermediate to each pair. It is evident we may continue the series as far as we
please. Now if we denote the first of any of the foregoing pairs of fractions by m
n
, the second
will be
m + 1
n
; and in general, in the case of two incommensurable quantities, two fractions m
n
and
m + 1
n
can always be found, where n can be made as large as we please, one of which is less
and the other greater than the true value of the ratio. For let a and b be the incommensurable
quantities; then, evidently, we cannot find two multiples na, mb, such that na = mb. In
this case, take any multiple of a, such as na, then this quantity must lie between some two
consecutive multiples of b, such as mb, and (m + 1)b; therefore na
mb
is greater than unity, and
na
(m + 1)b
less than unity. Hence
a
b
lies between
m
n
and
m + 1
n
. Now, since the difference
between
m
n
and
m + 1
n
namely,
1
n
becomes small as n increases, we see that the difference
between the ratio of two incommensurable quantities and that of two commensurable numbers
117
m and n can be made as small as we please. Hence, ultimately, the ratio of incommensurable
quantities may be regarded as the limit of the ratio of commensurable quantities.
5. The two terms of a ratio are called the antecedent and the consequent. These correspond
to the numerator and the denominator of a fraction. Hence we have the following definition:—
“A ratio is the fraction got by making the antecedent the numerator and the consequent the
denominator.”
6. The reciprocal of a ratio is the ratio obtained by interchanging the antecedent and the
consequent. Thus, 4 : 3 is the reciprocal of the ratio 3 : 4. Hence we have the following
theorem:—“The product of a ratio and its reciprocal is unity.”
7. If we multiply any two numbers, as 5 and 7, by any number such as 4, the products 20,
28 are called equimultiples of 5 and 7. In like manner, 10 and 15 are equimultiples of 2 and
3, and 18 and 30 of 3 and 5, &c.
v. The first of four magnitudes has to the second the same ratio which
the third has to the fourth, when any equimultiples whatsoever of the first and
third being taken, and any equimultiples whatsoever of the second and fourth,
if, according as the multiple of the first is greater than, equal to, or less than
the multiple of the second, the multiple of the third is greater than, equal to,
or less than the multiple of the fourth.
vi. Magnitudes which have the same ratio are called proportionals. When
four magnitudes are proportionals, it is usually expressed by saying, “The first
is to the second as the third is to the fourth.”
viii. Analogy or proportion is the similitude of ratios.
We have given the foregoing definitions in the order of Euclid, as given by Simson, Lardner,
and others;2 but it is evidently an inverted order; for vi. viii. are definitions of proportion,
and v. is only a test of proportion, and is not a definition but a theorem, and one which,
instead of being taken for granted, requires proof. The following explanations will give the
student clear conceptions of their meaning:—
1. If we take two ratios, such as 6 : 9 and 10 : 15, which are each equal to the same thing
(in this example each is equal to 2
3
), they are equal to one another (I. Axiom i.). Then we
may write it thus—
6 : 9 = 10 : 15.
This would be the most intelligible way, but it is not the usual one, which is as follows:—
6 : 9 :: 10 : 15. In this form it is called a proportion. Hence a proportion consists of two
ratios which are asserted by it to be equal. Its four terms consist of two antecedents and two
consequents. The 1st and 3rd terms are the antecedents, and the 2nd and 4th the consequents.
Also the first and last terms are called the extremes, and the two middle terms the means.
2. Since a proportion consists of two equal ratios, and each ratio can be written as a
fraction, whenever we have a proportion such as
a : b :: c : d,
we can write it in the form of two equal fractions. Thus:
a
b
=
c
d
.
Conversely, an equation between two fractions can be put into a proportion. By means of
these simple principles all the various properties of proportion can be proved in the most
direct and easy manner.
3. If we take the proportion a : b :: c : d, and multiply the first and third terms, each by
m, and second and fourth, each by n, we get the four multiples, ma, nb, mc, nd; and we want
to prove that if ma is greater than nb, mc is greater than nd; if equal, equal; and if less, less.
Dem.—Since a : b :: c : d,
we have
a
b
=
c
d
.
2Except that viii. is put before vii., because it relates, as v. and vi., to the equality of
ratios, whereas vii. is a test of their inequality.
118
Hence, multiplying each by
m
n
we get
ma
nb
=
mc
nd
.
Now, it is evident that if ma
nb
is greater than unity,
mc
nd
is greater than unity; but if ma
nb
is
greater than unity, ma is greater than nb; and if mc
nd
is greater than unity, mc is greater than
nd. In like manner, if ma be equal to nb, mc is equal to nd; and if less, less.
The foregoing is an easy proof of the converse of the theorem which is contained in Euclid’s
celebrated Fifth Definition.
Next, to prove Euclid’s theorem—that if, according as the multiple of the first of four
magnitudes is greater than, equal to, or less than the multiple of the second, the multiple of
the third is greater than, equal to, or less than the multiple of the fourth; the ratio of the first
to the second is equal to the ratio of the third to the fourth.
Dem.—Let, a, b, c, d be the four magnitudes. First suppose that a and b are commensurable, then it is evident that we can take multiples na, mb, such that na = mb. Hence, by
hypothesis, nc = md. Thus,
na
mb
= 1,
nc
md
= 1;
therefore a
b
=
c
d
.
Next, suppose a and b are incommensurable. Then, as in a recent note, we can find two
numbers m and n, such that
na
mb
is greater than unity, but
na
(m + 1)b
less than unity. Hence
a
b
lies between
m
n
and
m + 1
n
. Now, since by hypothesis, when
na
mb
is greater than unity,
nc
md
is greater than unity; and when
na
(m + 1)b
is less than unity,
nc
(m + 1)d
is less than unity.
Hence, since
a
b
lies between
m
n
and
m + 1
n
,
c
d
lies between the same quantities. Therefore
the difference between a
b
and
c
d
is less than
1
n
; and since n may be as large as we please, the
difference is nothing; therefore
a
b
=
c
d
.
vii. When of the multiples of four magnitudes (taken as in Def. v.) the
multiple of the first is greater than that of the second, but the multiple of the
third not greater than that of the fourth, the first has to the second a greater
ratio than the third has to the fourth.
This, instead of being a definition, is a theorem. We have altered the last clause from
that given in Simson’s Euclid, which runs thus:—“The first is said to have to the second a
greater ratio than the third has to the fourth.” This is misleading, as it implies that it is,
by convention, that the first ratio is greater than the second, whereas, in fact, such is not
the case; for it follows from the hypothesis that the first ratio is greater than the second; and
if it did not, it could not be made so by definition. We have made a similar change in the
enunciation of the Fifth Definition.
Let a, b, c, d be the four magnitudes, and m and n the multiples taken, it is required
to prove, that if ma be greater than nb, but mc not greater than nd, that the ratio a : b is
greater than the ratio c : d.
Dem.—Since ma is greater than nb, but mc not greater than nd, it is evident that
ma
nb
is greater than
mc
nd
;
therefore a
b
is greater than
c
d
;
that is, the ratio a : b is greater than the ratio c : d.
119
ix. Proportion consists of three terms at least.
This has the same fault as some of the others—it is not a definition, but an inference. It
occurs when the means in a proportion are equal, so that, in fact, there are four terms. As
an illustration, let us take the numbers 4, 6, 9. Here the ratio of 4 : 6 is 2
3
, and the ratio of
6 : 9 is 2
3
, so that 4, 6, 9 are continued proportionals; but, in reality, there are four terms, for
the full proportion is 4 : 6 :: 6 : 9.
x. When three magnitudes are continual proportionals, the first is said to
have to the third the duplicate ratio of that which it has to the second.
xi. When four magnitudes are continual proportionals, the first is said to
have to the fourth the triplicate ratio of that which it has to the second.
xii. When there is any number of magnitudes of the same kind greater than
two, the first is said to have to the last the ratio compounded of the ratios of
the first to the second, of the second to the third, of the third to the fourth, &c.
We have placed these definitions in a group; but their order is inverted, and, as we shall
see, Def. xii. is a theorem, and x. and xi. are only inferences from it.
1. If we have two ratios, such as 5 : 7 and 3 : 4, and if we convert each ratio into a fraction,
and multiply these fractions together, we get a result which is called the ratio compounded of
the two ratios; viz. in this example it is 15
28 , or 15 : 28. It is evident we get the same result if
we multiply the two antecedents together for a new antecedent, and the two consequents for
a new consequent. Hence we have the following definition:—“The ratio compounded of any
number of ratios it the ratio of the product of all the antecedents to the product of all the
consequents.”
2. To prove the theorem contained in Def. xii.
Let the magnitudes be a, b, c, d. Then the ratio of
1st : 2nd =
a
b
,
2nd : 3rd =
b
c
,
3rd : 4th =
c
d
.
Hence the ratio compounded of the ratio of 1st : 2nd, of 2nd : 3rd, of 3rd : 4th
=
abc
bcd
=
a
d
= ratio of 1st : 4th.
3. If three magnitudes be proportional, the ratio of the 1st : 3rd is equal to the square of
the ratio of the 1st : 2nd. For the ratio of the 1st : 3rd is compounded of the ratio of the 1st :
2nd, and of the ratio of the 2nd : 3rd; and since these ratios are equal, the ratio compounded
of them will be equal to the square of one of them.
Or thus: Let the proportionals be a, b, c, that is, let a : b :: b : c; hence we have
b
c
=
a
b
.
And multiplying each by a
b
, we get
a
c
=
a
2
b
2
;
or a : c :: a
2
: b
2—that is, 1st : 3rd :: square of 1st : square of 2nd. Now, the ratio of 1st : 3rd
is, by Def. x., the duplicate ratio of 1st : 2nd. Hence the duplicate ratio of two magnitudes
means the square of their ratio, or, what is the same thing, the ratio of their squares (see
Book VI. xx.).
4. If four magnitudes be continual proportionals, the ratio of 1st : 4th is equal to the cube
of the ratio of 1st : 2nd. This may be proved exactly like 3. Hence we see that what Euclid
calls triplicate ratio of two magnitudes is the ratio of their cubes, or the cube of their ratio.
120
We also see that there is no necessity to introduce extraneous magnitudes for the purpose
of defining duplicate and triplicate ratios, as Euclid does. In fact, the definitions by squares
and cubes are more explicit.
xiii. In proportionals, the antecedent terms are called homologous to one
another; as also the consequents to one another.
If one proportion be given, from it an indefinite number of other proportions can be
inferred, and a great part of the theory of proportion consists in proving the truth of these
derived proportions. Geometers make use of certain technical terms to denote the most
important of these processes. We shall indicate these terms by including them in parentheses
in connexion with the Propositions to which they refer. They are useful as indicating, by one
word, the whole enunciation of a theorem.
Every Proposition in the Fifth Book is a Theorem.
PROP. I.—Theorem.
If any number of magnitudes of the same kind (a, b, c, &c.), be equimultiples
of as many others (a
0
, b0
, c0
, &c.), then the sum of the first magnitudes (a+b+
c, &c.) shall be the same multiple of the sum of the second which any magnitude
of the first system is of the corresponding magnitude of the second system.
Dem.—Let m denote the multiple which the magnitudes of the first system
are of those of the second system.
Then we have a = ma0
(hyp.),
b = mb0
,
c = mc0
.
&c., &c.
Hence, by addition,
(a + b + c + &c.) = m(a
0 + b
0 + c
0
, &c.).
PROP. II.—Theorem.
If two magnitudes of the same kind (a, b) be the same multiples of another
(c) which two corresponding magnitudes (a
0
, b0
) are of another (c
0
), then the
sum of the two first is the same multiple of their submultiple which the sum of
their corresponding magnitudes is of their submultiple.
Dem.—Let m and n be the multiples which a and b are of c.
Then we have
a = mc and a
0 = mc0
,
b = nc and b
0 = nc0
.
Therefore
(a + b) = (m + n)c, and (a
0 + b
0
) = (m + n)c
0
.
Hence a + b is the same multiple of c that a
0 + b
0
is of c
0
.
This Proposition is evidently true for any number of multiples.
121
PROP. III.—Theorem.
If two magnitudes (a, b) be equimultiples of two others (a
0
, b0
); then any
equimultiples of the first magnitudes (a, b) will be also equimultiples of the second
magnitudes (a
0
, b0
).
Dem.—Let m denote the multiples which a, b are of a
0
, b
0
; then we have
a = ma0
, b = mb0
.
Hence, multiplying each equation by n, we get
na = mna0
, nb = mnb0
.
Hence, na, nb are equimultiples of a
0
, b
0
.
PROP. IV.—Theorem.
If four magnitudes be proportional, and if any equimultiples of the first and
third be taken, and any other equimultiples of the second and fourth; then the
multiple of the first : the multiple of the second :: the multiple of the third : the
multiple of the fourth.
Let a : b :: c : d; then ma : nb :: mc : nd.
Dem.—We have a : b :: c : d (hyp.);
therefore a
b
=
c
d
.
Hence, multiplying each fraction by m
n
, we get
ma
nb =
mc
nd ;
therefore ma : nb :: mc : nd.
PROP. V.—Theorem.
If two magnitudes of the same kind (a, b) be the same multiples of another
(c) which two corresponding magnitudes (a
0
, b0
) are of another (c
0
), then the
difference of the two first is the same multiple of their submultiple (c), which the
difference of their corresponding magnitudes is of their submultiple (c
0
) (compare
Proposition ii.).
Dem.—Let m and n be the multiples which a and b are of c.
Then we have a = mc, and a
0 = mc0
,
b = nc, and b
0 = nc0
.
Therefore (a ? b) = (m ? n)c, and (a
0 ? b
0
) = (m ? n)c
0
. Hence a ? b is the
same multiple of c that a
0 ? b
0
is of c
0
.
Cor.—If a ? b = c, a
0 ? b
0 = c
0
; for if a ? b = c, m ? n = 1.

PROP. VI.—Theorem.
If a magnitude (a) be the same multiple of another (b), which a magnitude
(a
0
) taken from the first is of a magnitude (b
0
) taken from the second, the remainder is the same multiple of the remainder that the whole is of the whole
(compare Proposition i.).
Dem.—Let m denote the multiples which the magnitudes a, a
0 are of b, b
0
;
then we have
a = mb,
a
0 = mb0
.
Hence (a ? a
0
) = m(b ? b
0
).
Prop. A.—Theorem (Simson).
If two ratios be equal, then according as the antecedent of the first ratio is
greater than, equal to, or less than its consequent, the antecedent of the second
ratio is greater than, equal to, or less than its consequent.
Dem.—Let a : b :: c : d;
then a
b
=
c
d
;
and if a be greater than b,
a
b
is greater than unity; therefore c
d
is greater than
unity, and c is greater than d.
In like manner, if a be equal to b, c is equal to d, and if less, less.
Prop. B.—Theorem (Simson).
If two ratios are equal their reciprocals are equal (invertendo).
Let a : b :: c : d, then b : a :: d : c.
Dem.—Since a : b :: c : d;
then a
b
=
c
d
;
therefore 1 ÷
a
b
= 1 ÷
c
d
,
or
b
a
=
d
c
Hence b : a :: d : c.
123
Prop. C.—Theorem (Simson).
If the first of four magnitudes be the same multiple of the second which the
third is of the fourth, the first is to the second as the third is to the fourth.
Let a = mb, c = md; then a : b :: c : d.
Dem.—Since a = mb, we have a
b
= m.
In like manner, c
d
= m; therefore a
b
=
c
d
.
Hence a : b :: c : d.
Prop. D.—Theorem (Simson).
If the first be to the second as to the third is to the fourth, and if the first
be a multiple or submultiple of the second, the third is the same multiple or
submultiple of the fourth.
1. Let a : b :: c : d, and let a be a multiple of b, then c is the same multiple
of d.
Dem.—Let a = mb, then a
b
= m;
but a
b
=
c
d
; therefore c
d
= m, and c = md.
2. Let a =
b
n
, then a
b
=
1
n
;
therefore c
d
=
1
n
,
Hence c =
d
n
.
PROP. VII.—Theorem.
1. Equal magnitudes have equal ratios to the same magnitude.
2. The same magnitude has equal ratios to equal magnitudes.
Let a and b be equal magnitudes, and c any other magnitude.
Then 1. a : c :: b : c,
2. c : a :: c : b.
Dem.—Since a = b, dividing each by c, we have
a
c
=
b
c
;
therefore a : c :: b : c.
124
Again, since a = b, dividing c by each, we have
c
a
=
c
b
;
therefore c : a :: c : b.
Observation.—2 follows at once from 1 by Proposition B.
PROP. VIII.—Theorem.
1. Of two unequal magnitudes, the greater has a greater ratio to any third
magnitude than the less has; 2. any third magnitude has a greater ratio to the
less of two unequal magnitudes than it has to the greater.
1. Let a be greater than b, and let c be any other magnitude of the same
kind, then the ratio a : c is greater than the ratio b : c.
Dem.—Since a is greater than b, dividing each by c,
a
c
is greater than b
c
;
therefore the ratio a : c is greater than the ratio b : c.
2. To prove that the ratio c : b is greater than the ratio c : a.
Dem.—Since b is less than a, the quotient which is the result of dividing
any magnitude by b is greater than the quotient which is got by dividing the
same magnitude by a;
therefore c
b
is greater than c
a
.
Hence the ratio c : b is greater than the ratio c : a.
PROP. IX.—Theorem.
Magnitudes which have equal ratios to the same magnitude are equal to one
another; 2. magnitudes to which the same magnitude has equal ratios are equal
to one another.
1. If a : c :: b : c, to prove a = b.
Dem.—Since a : c :: b : c,
a
c
=
b
c
.
Hence, multiplying each by c, we get a = b.
2. If c : a :: c : b, to prove a = b.
Dem.—Since c : a :: c : b,
by inversion, a : c :: b : c;
therefore a = b. [1].
125
PROP. X.—Theorem.
Of two unequal magnitudes, that which has the greater ratio to any third is
the greater of the two; and that to which any third has the greater ratio is the
less of the two.
1. If the ratio a : c be greater than the ratio b : c, to prove a greater than b.
Dem.—Since the ratio a : c is greater than the ratio b : c,
a
c
is greater than b
c
.
Hence, multiplying each by c, we get a greater than b.
2. If the ratio c : b is greater than the ratio c : a, to prove b is less than a.
Dem.—Since the ratio c : b is greater than the ratio c : a,
c
b
is greater than c
a
.
Hence 1 ÷
c
b
is less than 1 ÷
c
a
,
that is, b
c
is less than a
c
.
Hence, multiplying each by c, we get
b less than a.
PROP. XI.—Theorem.
Ratios that are equal to the same ratio are equal to one another.
Let a : b :: e : f, and c : d :: e : f, to prove a : b :: c : d.
Dem.—Since a : b :: e : f,
a
b
=
e
f
.
In like manner, c
d
=
e
f
.
Hence a
b
=
c
d
[I., Axiom i.],
and a : b :: c : d.
126
PROP. XII.—Theorem.
If any number of ratios be equal to one another, any one of these equal
ratios is equal to the ratio of the sum of all the antecedents to the sum of all the
consequents.
Let the ratios a : b, c : d, e : f, be all equal to one another; it is required to
prove that any of these ratios is equal to the ratio a + c + e : b + d + f.
Dem.—By hypotheses,
a
b
=
c
d
=
e
f
.
Since these fractions are all equal, let their common value be r; then we have
a
b
= r,
c
d
= r,
e
f
= r;
therefore a = br,
c = dr,
e = fr ;
therefore a + c + e = (b + d + f)r.
Hence a + c + e
b + d + f
= r ;
therefore a
b
=
a + c + e
b + d + f
,
and a : b :: a + c + e : b + d + f.
Cor.—With the same hypotheses, if l, m, n be any three multipliers, a : b ::
la + mc + ne : lb + md + nf.
PROP. XIII.—Theorem.
If two ratios are equal, and if one of them be greater than any third ratio, then
the other is also greater than that third ratio.
If a : b :: c : d, but the ratio of c : d greater than the ratio of e : f; then the
ratio of a : b is greater than the ratio of e : f.
Dem.—Since the ratio of c : d is greater than the ratio of e : f,
c
d
is greater than e
f
.
Again, since a : b :: c : d,
a
b
=
c
d
;
therefore a
b
is greater than e
f
.
or the ratio of a : b is greater than the ratio of e : f.
127
PROP. XIV.—Theorem.
If two ratios be equal, then, according as the antecedent of the first ratio is
greater than, equal to, or less than the antecedent of the second, the consequent
of the first is greater than, equal to, or less than the consequent of the second.
Let a : b :: c : d; then if a be greater than c, b is greater than d; if equal,
equal; if less, less.
Dem.—Since a : b :: c : d.
we have a
b
=
c
d
,
and multiplying each by b
c
we get
a
b
×
b
c
=
c
d
×
b
c
,
or
a
c
=
b
d
;
therefore a : c :: b : d.
Hence, Proposition [A], if a be greater than c, b is greater than d; if equal, equal;
and if less, less.
PROP. XV.—Theorem.
Magnitudes have the same ratio which all equimultiples of them have.
Let a, b be two magnitudes, then the ratio a : b is equal to the ratio ma : mb.
Dem.—The ratio a : b =
a
b
, and the ratio of ma : mb =
ma
mb ; but since the
value of a fraction is not altered by multiplying its numerator and denominator
by the same number,
a
b
=
ma
mb ;
therefore a : b :: ma : mb.
PROP. XVI—Theorem.
If four magnitudes of the same kind be proportionals they are also
proportionals by alternation (alternando).
Let a : b :: c : d, then a : c :: b : d.
Dem.—Since a : b :: c : d,
a
b
=
c
d
,
128
and multiplying each by b
c
, we get
a
b
.
b
c
=
c
d
.
b
c
,
or
a
c
=
b
d
;
therefore a : c :: b : d.
PROP. XVII.—Theorem.
If four magnitudes be proportional, the difference between the first and second
: the second :: the difference between the third and fourth : the fourth (dividendo).
Let a : b :: c : d : then a ? b : b :: c ? d : d;
Dem.—Since a : b :: c : d,
a
b
=
c
d
;
therefore a
b
? 1 =
c
d
? 1,
or
a ? b
b
=
c ? d
d
;
therefore a ? b : b :: c ? d : d.
PROP. XVIII.—Theorem.
If four magnitudes be proportionals, the sum of the first and second : the
second :: the sum of the third and fourth : the fourth (componendo).
Let a : b :: c : d; then a + b : b :: c + d : d.
Dem.—Since a : b :: c : d,
a
b
=
c
d
;
therefore a
b

c
d

or
a + b
b
=
c + d
d

therefore a + b : b :: c + d : d.
129
PROP. XIX.—Theorem.
If a whole magnitude be to another whole at a magnitude taken from the
first it to a magnitude taken from the second, the first remainder : the second
remainder :: the first whole : the second whole.
Let a : b :: c : d, c and d being less than a and b;
then a ? c : b ? d :: a : b.
Dem.—Since a : b :: c : d,
then a : c :: b : d [alternando],
and c : a :: d : b [invertendo];
therefore c
a
=
d
b
,
and 1 ?
c
a

or
a ? c

Hence a ? c : b ? d :: a : b.
Prop. E.—Theorem (Simson).
If four magnitudes be proportional, the first : its excess above the second :: the
third : its excess above the fourth (convertendo).
Let a : b :: c : d; then a : a ? b :: c : c ? d.
Dem.—Since a : b :: c : d,
a
b
=
c
d
;
therefore a ? b
b

c ? d

[Dem. of xvii.],
therefore a

PROP. XX.—Theorem.
If there be two sets of three magnitudes, which taken two by two in direct
order have equal ratios, then if the first of either set be greater than the third,
the first of the other set is greater than the third; if equal, equal; and if less, less.
130
Let a, b, c; a

0 be the two sets of magnitudes, and let the ratio a : b =
a

0

Dem.—Since a : b :: a

we have a
b
=
a

b

In like manner, b

Therefore if a be greater than c, a

PROP. XXI.—Theorem.
If there be two sets of three magnitudes, which taken two by two in transverse
order have equal ratios; then, if the first of either set be greater than the third,
the first of the other set is greater than the third; if equal, equal; and if less, less.
Let a, b, c; a
0

0 be the two sets of magnitudes, and let the ratio a : b =
b
0
: c
0

0
. Then, if a be greater than, equal to, or less than c, a

Dem.—Since a : b :: b

c

In like manner, b
c

Hence, multiplying a

Therefore, if a be greater than c, a

PROP. XXII.—Theorem.
If there be two sets of magnitudes, which, taken two by two in direct order,
have equal ratios, then the first : the last of the first set :: the first : the last of
the second set (“ex aequali,” or “ex aequo”).
131
Let a, b, c; a

Hence, multiplying, a

Therefore a : c :: a

and similarly for any number of magnitudes in each set.
Cor. 1.—If the ratio b : c be equal to the ratio a : b, then a, b, c will be in
continued proportion, and so will a

Therefore a

Or if four magnitudes be proportional, their squares are proportional.

PROP. XXIII.—Theorem.
If there be two sets of magnitudes, which, taken two by two in transverse
order, have equal ratios; then the first : the last of the first set :: the first : the
last of the second set (“ex aequo perturbato”).
Let a, b, c; a

In like manner, b

and similarly for any number of magnitudes in each set.
This Proposition and the preceding one may be included in one enunciation,
thus: “Ratios compounded of equal ratios are equal.”
PROP. XXIV.—Theorem.
If two magnitudes of the same kind (a, b) have to a third magnitude (c)
ratios equal to those which two other magnitudes (a
0
, b0
) have to a third (c
0
),
then the sum (a + b) of the first two has the same ratio to their third (c) which
the sum (a
0 + b
0
) of the other two magnitudes has to their third (c
0
).
Dem.—Since a : c :: a

c

In like manner, b

therefore, adding, a + b

Hence a + b : c :: a

PROP. XXV.—Theorem.
If four magnitudes of the same kind be proportionals, the sum of the greatest
and least is greater than the sum of the other two.
Let a : b :: c : d; then, if a be the greatest, d will be the least [xiv. and a].
It is required to prove that a + d is greater than b + c.
Dem.—Since a : b :: c : d,
a : c :: b : d [alternando];
therefore a : a ? c :: b : b ? d [E].;
but a is greater than b (hyp.),
therefore a ? c is greater than b ? d [xiv.].
Hence a + d is greater than b + c.

APPLICATION OF THE THEORY OF PROPORTION
DEFINITIONS.
i. Similar Rectilineal Figures are those whose several angles are equal, each
to each, and whose sides about the equal angles are proportional.
Similar figures agree in shape; if they agree also in size, they are congruent.
1. When the shape of a figure is given, it is said to be given in species. Thus a triangle
whose angles are given is given in species. Hence similar figures are of the same species.
2. When the size of a figure is given, it is said to be given in magnitude; for instance, a
square whose side is of given length.
3. When the place which a figure occupies is known, it is said to be given in position.
ii. A right line is said to be cut at a point in extreme and mean ratio when
the whole line is to the greater segment as the greater segment is to the less.
iii. If three quantities of the same kind be in continued proportion, the
middle term is called a mean proportional between the other two.
Magnitudes in continued proportion are also said to be in geometrical progression.
iv. If four quantities of the same kind be in continued proportion, the two
middle terms are called two mean proportionals between the other two.
v. The altitude of any figure is the length of the perpendicular from its
highest point to its base.
vi. Two corresponding angles of two figures have the sides about them
reciprocally proportional, when a side of the first is to a side of the second as
the remaining side of the second is to the remaining side of the first.
This is evidently equivalent to saying that a side of the first is to a side of the second in
the reciprocal ratio of the remaining side of the first to the remaining side of the second.
PROP. I.—Theorem.
Triangles (ABC, ACD) and parallelograms (EC, CF) which have the same
altitude are to one another as their bases (BC, CD).
Dem.—Produce BD both
ways, and cut off any number of
parts BG, GH, &c., each equal to
CB, and any number DK, KL,
each equal to CD. Join AG, AH,
AK, AL.
Now, since the several bases CB, BG, GH are all equal, the triangles ACB,
ABG, AGH are also all equal [I. xxxviii.]. Therefore the triangle ACH is the
same multiple of ACB that the base CH is of the base CB. In like manner,
135
the triangle ACL is the same multiple of ACD that the base CL is of the base
CD; and it is evident that [I. xxxviii.] if the base HC be greater than CL,
the triangle HAC is greater than CAL; if equal, equal; and if less, less. Now
we have four magnitudes: the base BC is the first, the base CD the second,
the triangle ABC the third, and the triangle ACD the fourth. We have taken
equimultiples of the first and third, namely, the base CH, and the triangle
ACH; also equimultiples of the second and fourth, namely, the base CL, and
the triangle ACL; and we have proved that according as the multiple of the first
is greater than, equal to, or less than the multiple of the second, the multiple
of the third is greater than, equal to, or less than the multiple of the fourth.
Hence [V. Def. v.] the base BC : CD :: the triangle ABC : ACD.
2. The parallelogram EC is double of the triangle ABC [I. xxxiv.], and the
parallelogram CF is double of the triangle ACD. Hence [V. xv.] EC : CF ::
the triangle ABC : ACD; but ABC : ACD :: BC : CD (Part I.). Therefore
[V. xi.] EC : CF :: the base BC : CD.
Or thus: Let A, A0 denote the areas of the triangles ABC, ACD, respectively, and P
their common altitude; then [II. i., Cor. 1],
A = 1
2
P . BC, A0 = 1
2
P . CD.
Hence
A
A0
=
BC
CD
, or A : A
0
:: BC : CD.
In extending this proof to parallelograms we have only to use P instead of 1

P.
PROP. II.—Theorem.
If a line (DE) be parallel to a side (BC) of a triangle (ABC), it divides
the remaining sides, measured from the opposite angle (A), proportionally; and,
conversely, If two sides of a triangle, measured from an angle, be cut proportionally, the line joining the points of section is parallel to the third side.
1. It is required to prove that AD : DB :: AE : EC.
Dem.—Join BE, CD. The triangles BDE, CED
are on the same base DE, and between the same parallels BC, DE. Hence [I. xxxvii.] they are equal, and
therefore [V. vii.] the triangle ADE : BDE :: ADE :
CDE;
but ADE : BDE :: AD : DB [i.],
and ADE : CDE :: AE : EC [i.].
Hence AD : DB :: AE : EC.
2. If AD : DB :: AE : EC, it is required to prove that DE is parallel to BC.
Dem.—Let the same construction be made;
then AD : DB :: the triangle ADE : BDE [i.].
and AE : EC :: the triangle ADE : CDE [i.];
but AD : DB :: AE : EC (hyp.).
Hence ADE : BDE :: ADE : CDE.
136
Therefore [V. ix.] the triangle BDE is equal to CDE, and they are on the same
base DE, and on the same side of it; hence they are between the same parallels
[I. xxxix.]. Therefore DE is parallel to BC.
Observation.—The line DE may cut the sides AB, AC produced through B, C, or through
the angle A; but evidently a separate figure for each of these cases is unnecessary.
Exercise.
If two lines be cut by three or more parallels, the intercepts on one are proportional to
the corresponding intercepts on the other.
PROP. III.—Theorem.
If a line (AD) bisect any angle (A) of a triangle (ABC), it divides the
opposite side (BC) into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. Conversely,
If the segments (BD, DC) into which a line (AD) drawn from any angle (A)
of a triangle divides the opposite side be proportional to the adjacent sides, that
line bisects the angle (A).
Dem.—1. Through C draw CE parallel to AD,
to meet BA produced in E. Because BA meets the
parallels AD, EC, the angle BAD [I. xxix.] is equal
to AEC; and because AC meets the parallels AD,
EC, the angle DAC is equal to ACE; but the angle
BAD is equal to DAC (hyp.); therefore the angle
ACE is equal to AEC; therefore AE is equal to AC
[I. vi.]. Again, because AD is parallel to EC, one of
the sides of the triangle BEC, BD : DC :: BA : AE [ii.]; but AE has been
proved equal to AC. Therefore BD : DC :: BA : AC.
2. If BD : DC :: BA : AC, the angle BAC is bisected.
Dem.—Let the same construction be made.
Because AD is parallel to EC, BA : AE :: BD : DC [ii.]; but BD : DC ::
BA : AC (hyp.). Therefore [V. xi.] BA : AE :: BA : AC, and hence [V. ix.]
AE is equal to AC; therefore the angle AEC is equal to ACE; but AEC is
equal to BAD [I. xxix.], and ACE to DAC; hence BAD is equal to DAC, and
the line AD bisects the angle BAC.
Exercises.
1. If the line AD bisect the external vertical angle
CAE, BA : AC :: BD : DC, and conversely.
Dem.—Cut off AE = AC. Join ED. Then
the triangles ACD, AED are evidently congruent;
therefore the angle EDB is bisected; hence [iii.] BA :
AE :: BD : DE; or BA : AC :: BD : DC.
2. Exercise 1 has been proved by quoting Proposition iii. Prove it independently, and prove iii. as
an inference from it.
3. The internal and the external bisectors of the vertical angle of a triangle divide the
base harmonically (see Definition, p. 191).
137
4. Any line intersecting the legs of any angle is cut harmonically by the internal and
external bisectors of the angle.
5. Any line intersecting the legs of a right angle is cut harmonically by any two lines
through its vertex which make equal angles with either of its sides.
6. If the base of a triangle be given in magnitude and position, and the ratio of the sides,
the locus of the vertex is a circle which divides the base harmonically in the ratio of the sides.
7. If a, b, c denote the sides of a triangle ABC, and D, D0
the points where the internal
and external bisectors of A meet BC; prove
DD0 =
2abc
b
2 ? c

.
8. In the same case, if E, E0
, F, F
0 be points similarly determined on the sides CA, AB,
respectively; prove

and

PROP. IV.—Theorem.
The sides about the equal angles of equiangular triangles (BAC, CDE) are
proportional, and those which are opposite to the equal angles are homologous.
Dem.—Let the sides BC, CE, which are opposite to the equal angles A and D, be conceived
to be placed so as to form one continuous line,
the triangles being on the same side, and so that
the equal angles BCA, CED may not have a
common vertex.
Now, the sum of the angles ABC, BCA is
less than two right angles; but BCA is equal to
BED (hyp.). Therefore the sum of the angles ABE, BED is less than two
right angles; hence [I., Axiom xii.] the lines AB, ED will meet if produced.
Let them meet in F. Again, because the angle BCA is equal to BEF, the
line CA [I. xxviii.] is parallel to EF. In like manner, BF is parallel to CD;
therefore the figure ACDF is a parallelogram; hence AC is equal to DF, and
CD is equal to AF. Now, because AC is parallel to F E, BA : AF :: BC : CE
[ii.]; but AF is equal to CD, therefore BA : CD :: BC : CE; hence [V. xvi.];
AB : BC :: DC : CE. Again, because CD is parallel to BF, BC : CE :: F D :
DE; but F D is equal to AC, therefore BC : CE :: AC : DE; hence [V. xvi.]
BC : AC :: CE : DE. Therefore we have proved that AB : BC :: DC : CE,
and that BC : CA :: CE : ED. Hence (ex aequali) AB : AC :: DC : DE.
Therefore the sides about the equal angles are proportional.
This Proposition may also be proved very simply by superposition. Thus (see fig.,
Prop. ii.): let the two triangles be ABC, ADE; let the second triangle ADE be conceived to
be placed on ABC, so that its two sides AD, AE may fall on the sides AB, AC; then, since the
angle ADE is equal to ABC, the side DE is parallel to BC. Hence [ii.] AD : DB :: AE : EC;
hence AD : AB :: AE : AC, and [V. xvi.] AD : AE :: AB : AC. Therefore the sides about
the equal angles BAC, DAE are proportional, and similarly for the others.
138
It can be proved by this Proposition that two lines which meet at infinity are parallel.
For, let I denote the point at infinity through which the two given lines pass, and draw any
two parallels intersecting them in the points A, B; A0
, B0
; then the triangles AIB, A0
IB0 are
equiangular; therefore AI : AB :: A0
I : A0B0
; but the first term of the proportion is equal
to the third; therefore [V. xiv.] the second term AB is equal to the fourth A0B0
, and, being
parallel to it, the lines AA0
, BB0
[I. xxxiii.] are parallel.
Exercises.
1. If two circles intercept equal chords AB, A0B0 on any secant, the tangents AT, A0T to
the circles at the points of intersection are to one another as the radii of the circles.
2. If two circles intercept on any secant chords that have a given ratio, the tangents to
the circles at the points of intersection have a given ratio, namely, the ratio compounded of
the direct ratio of the radii and the inverse ratio of the chords.
3. Being given a circle and a line, prove that a point may be found, such that the rectangle
of the perpendiculars let fall on the line from the points of intersection of the circle with any
chord through the point shall be given.
4. AB is the diameter of a semicircle ADB; CD a perpendicular to AB; draw through A
a chord AF of the semicircle meeting CD in E, so that the ratio CE : EF may be given.
PROP. V.–Theorem.
If two triangles (ABC, DEF) have their sides proportional (BA : AC ::
ED : DF; AC : CB :: DF : F E) they are equiangular, and those angles are
equal which are subtended by the homologous sides.
Dem.—At the points D, E make the
angles EDG, DEG equal to the angles A,
B of the triangle ABC. Then [I. xxxii.]
the triangles ABC, DEG are equiangular.
Therefore BA : AC :: ED : DG [iv.];
but BA : AC :: ED : DF (hyp.).
Therefore DG is equal to DF. In like manner it may be proved that EG is equal to
EF. Hence the triangles EDF, EDG have
the sides ED, DF in one equal to the sides
ED, DG in the other, and the base EF
equal to the base EG. Hence [I. viii.] they are equiangular; but the triangle
DEG is equiangular to ABC. Therefore the triangle DEF is equiangular to
ABC.
Observation.—In VI. Def. i. two conditions are laid down as necessary for the similitude
of rectilineal figures. 1. The equality of angles; 2. The proportionality of sides. Now, from
Propositions iv. and v., we see that if two triangles possess either condition, they also possess
the other. Triangles are unique in this respect. In all other rectilineal figures one of the conditions may exist without the other. Thus, two quadrilaterals may have their sides proportional
without having equal angles, or vice versˆa.
139
PROP. VI.—Theorem.
If two triangles (ABC, DEF) have one angle (A) in one equal to one angle
(D) in the other, and the sides about these angles proportional (BA : AC ::
ED : DF), the triangles are equiangular, and have those angles equal which are
opposite to the homologous sides.
Dem.—Make the same construction as in the last Proposition; then the
triangles ABC, DEG are equiangular.
Therefore BA : AC :: ED : DG [iv.];
but BA : AC :: ED : DF (hyp.).
Therefore DG is equal to DF. Again, because the angle EDG is equal to BAC
(const.), and BAC equal to EDF (hyp.), the angle EDG is equal to EDF; and
it has been proved that DG is equal to DF, and DE is common; hence the
triangles EDG and EDF are equiangular; but EDG is equiangular to BAC.
Therefore EDF is equiangular to BAC.
[It is easy to see, as in the case of Proposition iv., that an immediate proof of this
Proposition can also be got from Proposition ii.].
Cor. 1.—If the ratio of two sides of a triangle be given, and the angle between
them, the triangle is given in species.
PROP. VII.—Theorem.
If two triangles (ABC, DEF) have one angle (A) one equal to one angle
(D) in the other, the sides about two other angles (B, E) proportional (AB :
BC :: DE : EF), and the remaining angles (C, F) of the same species (i. e.
either both acute or both not acute), the triangles are similar.
Dem.—If the angles B and E are not
equal, one must be greater than the other.
Suppose ABC to be the greater, and that
the part ABG is equal to DEF, then the
triangles ABG, DEF have two angles in
one equal to two angles in the other, and
are [I. xxxii.] equiangular.
Therefore AB : BG :: DE : EF [iv.];
but AB : BC :: DE : EF (hyp.).
Therefore BG is equal to BC. Hence the angles BCG, BGC must be each acute
[I. xvii.]; therefore AGB must be obtuse; hence DF E, which is equal to it, is
obtuse; and it has been proved that ACB is acute; therefore the angles ACB,
DF E are of different species; but (hyp.) they are of the same species, which
is absurd. Hence the angles B and E are not unequal, that is, they are equal.
Therefore the triangles are equiangular.
140
Cor. 1.—If two triangles ABC, DEF have two sides in one proportional to
two sides in the other, AB : BC :: DE : EF, and the angles A, D opposite one
pair of homologous sides equal, the angles C, F opposite the other are either
equal or supplemental. This Proposition is nearly identical with vii.
Cor. 2.—If either of the angles C, F be right, the other must be right.
PROP. VIII.—Theorem.
The triangles (ACD, BCD) into which a right-angled triangle (ACB) is
divided, by the perpendicular (CD) from the right angle (C) on the hypotenuse,
are similar to the whole and to one another.
Dem.—Since the two triangles ADC, ACB have the angle A common, and
the angles ADC, ACB equal, each being right, they are [I. xxxii.] equiangular;
hence [iv.] they are similar. In like manner it may be proved that BDC is
similar to ABC. Hence ADC, CDB are each similar to ACD, and therefore
they are similar to one another.
Cor. 1.—The perpendicular CD is a mean proportional between the segments AD, DB of the hypotenuse.
For, since the triangles ADC, CDB are equiangular, we have AD : DC :: DC : DB; hence DC is
a mean proportional between AD, DB (Def. iii.).
Cor. 2.—BC is a mean proportional between AB, BD; and AC between
AB, AD.
Cor. 3.—The segments AD, DB are in the duplicate of AC : CB, or in other
words, AD : DB :: AC2
: CB2
,
Cor. 4.—BA : AD in the duplicate ratios of BA : AC; and AB : BD in the
duplicate ratio of AB : BC.
PROP. IX.—Problem.
From a given right line (AB) to cut off any part required (i.e. to cut off any
required submultiple)
.
Sol.—Let it be required, for instance, to cut off the fourth part. Draw AF,
making any angle with AB, and in AF take any point C, and cut off (I. iii.)
the parts CD, DE, EF each equal to AC. Join BF, and draw CG parallel to
BF. AG is the fourth part of AB.
Dem.—Since CG is parallel to the side BF of
the triangle ABF, AC : AF :: AG : AB [ii.]; but
AC is the fourth part of AF (const.). Hence AG is
the fourth part of AB [V., d.]. In the same manner,
any other required submultiple may be cut off.
Proposition x., Book I., is a particular case of
this Proposition.
141
PROP. X.—Problem.
To divide a given undivided line (AB) similarly to a given divided line (CD).
Sol.—Draw AG, making any angle with
AB, and cut off the parts AH, HI, IG respectively equal to the parts CE, EF, F D
of the given divided line CD. Join BG, and
draw HK, IL, each parallel to BG. AB will
be divided similarly to CD.
Dem.—Through H draw HN parallel to
AB, cutting IL in M. Now in the triangle
ALI, HK is parallel to IL. Hence [ii.] AK : KL :: AH : HI, that is :: CE :
EF (const.). Again, in the triangle HNG, MI is parallel to NG. Therefore
[ii.] HM : MN :: HI : IG; but [I. xxxiv.] HM is equal to KL, MN is
equal to LB, HI is equal to EF, and IG is equal to F D (const.). Therefore
KL : LB :: EF : F D. Hence the line AB is divided similarly to the line CD.
Exercises.
1. To divide a given line AB internally or externally in the ratio of two given lines, m, n.
Sol.—Through A and B draw any two parallels AC and BD in opposite directions. Cut
off AC = m, and BD = n, and join CD; the joining line will divide AB internally at E in the
ratio of m : n.
2. If BD0 be drawn in the same direction with AC, as denoted by the dotted line, then
CD0 will cut AB externally at E0
in the ratio of m : n.
Cor.—The two points E, E0 divide AB harmonically.
This problem is manifestly equivalent to the following:—Given the sum or difference of
two lines and their ratio, to find the lines.
3. Any line AE0
, through the middle point B of the base DD0 of a triangle DCD0
, is cut
harmonically by the sides of the triangle and a parallel to the base through the vertex.
4. Given the sum of the squares on two lines and their ratio; find the lines.
5. Given the difference of the squares on two lines and their ratio; find the lines.
6. Given the base and ratio of the sides of a triangle; construct it when any of the following
data is given:—1, the area; 2, the difference on the squares of the sides; 3, the sum of the
squares on the sides; 4, the vertical angle; 5, the difference of the base angles.
142
PROP. XI.—Problem.
To find a third proportional to two given lines (X, Y ).
Sol.—Draw any two lines AC, AE making an angle. Cut off AB equal X,
BC equal Y , and AD equal Y . Join BD, and draw CE parallel to BD, then
DE is the third proportional required.
Dem.—In the triangle CAE,
BD is parallel to CE; therefore AB :
BC :: AD : DE [ii.]; but AB is equal
to X, and BC, AD each equal to Y .
Therefore X : Y :: Y : DE. Hence
DE is a third proportional to X and
Y .
Another solution can be inferred from Proposition viii. For if AD, DC in that Proposition
be respectively equal to X and Y , then DB will be the third proportional. Or again, if in the
diagram, Proposition viii., AD = X, and AC = Y , AB will be the third proportional. Hence
may be inferred a method of continuing the proportion to any number of terms.
Exercises.
1. If AO? be a triangle, having the
side A? greater than AO; then if we cut off
AB = AO, draw BB0 parallel to AO, cut
off BC = BB0
, &c., the series of lines AB,
BC, CD, &c., are in continual proportion.
2. AB ? BC : AB :: AB : A?. This is
evident by drawing through B0 a parallel
to A?.
PROP. XII.—Problem.
To find a fourth proportional to three given lines (X, Y, Z).
Sol.—Draw any two lines AC,
AE, making an angle; then cut off
AB equal X, BC equal Y , AD
equal Z. Join BD, and draw CE
parallel to BD. DE will be the
fourth proportional required.
Dem.—Since BD is parallel to
CE, we have [ii.] AB : BC :: AD :
DE; therefore X : Y :: Z : DE. Hence DE is a fourth proportional to X, Y ,
Z.
Or thus: Take two lines AD, BC intersecting
in O. Make OA = X, OB = Y , OC = Z, and
describe a circle through the points A, B, C [IV. v.]
cutting AD in D. OD will be the fourth proportional
required.
The demonstration is evident from the similarity
of the triangles AOB and COD.
143
PROP. XIII.—Problem.
To find a mean proportional between two given lines. (X, Y ).
Sol.—Take on any line
AC parts AB, BC respectively equal to X, Y . On AC
describe a semicircle ADC.
Erect BD at right angles to
AC, meeting the semicircle
in D. BD will be the mean
proportional required.
Dem.—Join AD, DC. Since ADC is a semicircle, the angle ADC is right
[III. xxxi.]. Hence, since ADC is a right-angled triangle, and BD a perpendicular from the right angle on the hypotenuse, BD is a mean proportional
[viii. Cor. 1] between AB, BC; that is, BD is a mean proportional between X
and Y .
Exercises.
1. Another solution may be inferred from Proposition viii., Cor. 2.
2. If through any point within a circle the chord be drawn, which is bisected in that point,
its half is a mean proportional between the segments of any other chord passing through the
same point.
3. The tangent to a circle from any external point is a mean proportional between the
segments of any secant passing through the same point.
4. If through the middle point C of any arc of a circle any secant be drawn cutting the
chord of the arc in D, and the circle again in E, the chord of half the arc is a mean proportional
between CD and CE.
5. If a circle be described touching another circle internally and two parallel chords, the
perpendicular from the centre of the former on the diameter of the latter, which bisects the
chords, is a mean proportional between the two extremes of the three segments into which
the diameter is divided by the chords.
6. If a circle be described touching a semicircle and its diameter, the diameter of the circle
is a harmonic mean between the segments into which the diameter of the semicircle is divided
at the point of contact.
7. State and prove the Proposition corresponding to Ex. 5, for external contact of the
circles.
PROP. XIV.—Theorem.
1. Equiangular parallelograms (AB, CD)
which are equal in area have the sides about
the equal angles reciprocally proportional—
AC : CE :: GC : CB.
2. Equiangular parallelograms which have
the sides about the equal angles reciprocally
proportional are equal in area.
Dem.—Let AC, CE be so placed as to
form one right line, and that the equal angles
144
ACB, ECG may be vertically opposite. Now, since the angle ACB is equal to
ECG, to each add BCE, and we have the sum of the angles ACB, BCE equal
to the sum of the angles ECG, BCE; but the sum of ACB, BCE is [I. xiii.]
two right angles. Therefore the sum of ECG, BCE is two right angles. Hence
[I. xiv.] BC, CG form one right line. Complete the parallelogram BE.
Again, since the parallelograms AB, CD are equal (hyp.),
AB : CF :: CD : CF [V. vii.];
but AB : CF :: AC : CE [i.];
and CD : CF :: GC : CB [i.];
therefore AC : CE :: GC : CB;
that is, the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.
2. Let AC : CE :: GC : CB, to prove the parallelograms AB, CD are equal.
Dem.—Let the same construction be made, we have
AB : CF :: AC : CE [i.];
and CD : CF :: GC : CB [i.];
but AC : CE :: GC : CB (hyp.).
Therefore AB : CF :: CD : CF.
Hence AB = CD [V. ix.];
that is, the parallelograms are equal.
Or thus: Join HE, BE, HD, BD. The HC = twice the 4 HBE, and the CD =
twice the 4 BDE. Therefore the 4 HBE = BDE, and [I. xxxix.] HD is parallel to BE.
Hence
HB : BF :: DE : EF; that is, AC : CE :: GC : CB.
2. May be proved by reversing this demonstration.
Another demonstration of this Proposition may be got by producing the lines HA and
DG to meet in I. Then [I. xliii.] the points I, C, F are collinear, and the Proposition is
evident.
PROP. XV.—Theorem.
1. Two triangles equal in area (ACB, DCE),
which have one angle (C) in one equal to one angle
(C) in the other, have the sides about these angles reciprocally proportional.
2. Two triangles, which have one angle in one equal
to one angle in the other, and the sides about these angles reciprocally proportional, are equal in area.
Dem.—1. Let the equal angles be so placed as to
be vertically opposite, and that AC, CD may form one right line; then it may
be demonstrated, as in the last Proposition, that BC, CE form one right line.
Join BD.
145
Now since the triangles ACB, DCE are equal,
ACB : BCD :: DCE : BCD [V. vii.];
but ACB : BCD :: AC : CD [i.],
and DCE : BCD :: EC : CB [i.].
Therefore AC : CD :: EC : CB;
that is, the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.
2. If AC : CD :: EC : CB, to prove the triangle ACB equal to DCE.
Dem.—Let the same construction be made, then we have
AC : CD :: triangle ACB : BCD [i.],
and EC : CB :: triangle DCE : BCD [i.];
but AC : CD :: EC : CB (hyp.).
Therefore the triangle
ACB : BCD :: DCE : BCD.
Hence the triangle ACB = DCE [V. ix.]—that is, the triangles are equal.
This Proposition might have been appended as a Cor. to the preceding, since the triangles
are the halves of equiangular parallelograms, or it may be proved by joining AE, and showing
that it is parallel to BD.
PROP. XVI.—Theorem.
1. If four right lines (AB, CD, E, F) be proportional, the rectangle (AB . F)
contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle (CD . E) contained by the
means.
2. If the rectangle contained by the extremes of four right lines be equal to
the rectangle contained by the means, the four lines are proportional.
Dem.—1. Erect AH, CI at right
angles to AB and CD, and equal
to F and E respectively, and complete the rectangles. Then because
AB : CD :: E : F (hyp.), and that E
is equal to CI, and F to AH (const.),
we have AB : CD :: CI : AH.
Hence the parallelograms AG, CK
are equiangular, and have the sides
about their equal angles reciprocally proportional. Therefore they are [xiv.]
equal; but since AH is equal to F, AG is equal to the rectangle AB . F. In like
manner, CK is equal to the rectangle CD . E. Hence AB . F = CD . E; that
is, the rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained by
the means.
146
2. If AB . F = CD . E, to prove AB : CD :: E : F.
The same construction being made, because AB . F = CD . E, and that
F is equal to AH, and E to CI, we have the parallelogram AG = CK; and
since these parallelograms are equiangular, the sides about their equal angles
are reciprocally proportional. Therefore
AB : CD :: CI : AH; that is, AB : CD :: E : F.
Or thus: Place the four lines in a concurrent position so
that the extremes may form one continuous line, and the means
another. Let the four lines so placed be AO, BO, OD, OC.
Join AB, CD. Then because AO : OB :: OD : OC, and the
angle AOB = DOC, the triangles AOB, COD are equiangular.
Hence the four points A, B, C, D are concyclic. Therefore
[III. xxxv.] AO . OC = BO . OD.
PROP. XVII.—Theorem
1. If three right lines (A, B, C) be proportional, the rectangle (A . C) contained by the extremes is equal to the square (B2
) of the mean.
2. If the rectangle contained by the extremes of three right lines be equal to
the square of the mean, the three lines are proportional.
Dem.—1. Assume a line D = B; then because
A : B :: B : C, we have A : B :: D : C. Therefore
[xvi.] AC = BD; but BD = B2
. Therefore AC =
B2
; that is, the rectangle contained by the extremes
is equal to the square of the mean.
2. The same construction being made, since
AC = B2
, we have A . C = B . D; therefore A : B :: D : C; but D = B. Hence
A : B :: B : C; that is, the three lines are proportionals.
This Proposition may be inferred as a Cor. to the last, which is one of the fundamental
Propositions in Mathematics.
Exercises.
1. If a line CD bisect the vertical angle C of any triangle
ACB, its square added to the rectangle AD . DB contained by
the segments of the base is equal to the rectangle contained by
the sides.
Dem.—Describe a circle about the triangle, and produce
CD to meet it in E; then it is easy to see that the triangles
ACD, ECB are equiangular. Hence [iv.] AC : CD :: CE : CB;
therefore AC . CB = CE . CD = CD2 + CD . DE = CD2 +
AD . DB [III. xxxv.].
2. If the line CD0 bisect the external vertical angle of any triangle ACB, its square subtracted from the rectangle AD0
. D0B
is equal to AC . CB.
3. The rectangle contained by the diameter of the circumscribed circle, and the radius of
the inscribed circle of any triangle, is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of any
chord of the circumscribed circle passing through the centre of the inscribed.
147
Dem.—Let O be the centre of the inscribed circle. Join OB (see foregoing fig.); let fall
the perpendicular OG, draw the diameter EF of the circumscribed circle. Now the angle
ABE = ECB [III. xxvii.], and ABO = OBC; therefore EBO = sum of OCB, OBC = EOB.
Hence EB = EO. Again, the triangles EBF, OGC are equiangular, because EF B, ECB
are equal, and EBF, OGC are each right. Therefore, EF : EB :: OC : OG; therefore
EF . OG = EB . OC = EO . OC.
4. Ex. 3 may be extended to each of the escribed circles of the triangle ACB.
5. The rectangle contained by two sides of a triangle is equal to the rectangle contained by
the perpendicular and the diameter of the circumscribed circle. For, let CE be the diameter.
Join AE. Then the triangles ACE, DCB are equiangular; hence AC : CE :: CD : CB;
therefore AC . CB = CD . CE.
6. If a circle passing through one of the angles A of a
parallelogram ABCD intersect the two sides AB, AD again
in the points E, G and the diagonal AC again in F; then
AB . AE + AD . AG = AC . AF.
Dem.—Join EF, F G, and make the angle ABH =
AF E. Then the triangles ABH, AF E are equiangular.
Therefore AB : AH :: AF : AE. Hence AB . AE =
AF . AH. Again, it is easy to see that the triangles BCH,
F AG are equiangular; therefore BC : CH :: AF : AG; hence
BC . AG = AF . CH, or AD . AG = AF . CH; but we have
proved AB . AE = AF . AH. Hence AD . AG + AB . AE =
AF . AC.
7. If DE, DF be parallels to the sides of a triangle ABC
from any point D in the base, then AB . AE + AC . AF = AD2 + BD . DC. This is an easy
deduction from 6.
8. If through a point O within a triangle ABC
parallels EF, GH, IK to the sides be drawn, the
sum of the rectangles of their segments is equal
to the rectangle contained by the segments of any
chord of the circumscribing circle passing through
O.
Dem.—AO . AL = AB . AK + AC . AE. (6)
But AO2 = AG . AK + AH . AE ? GO . OH. (7)
Hence AO . OL = BG . AK + CH . AE + GO . OH,
or AO . OL = EO . OF + IO . OK + GO . OH.
9. The rectangle contained by the side of an inscribed
square standing on the base of a triangle, and the sum of
the base and altitude, is equal to twice the area of the triangle.
10. The rectangle contained by the side of an escribed square standing on the base of a
triangle, and the difference between the base and altitude, is equal to twice the area of the
triangle.
148
11. If from any point P in the circumference of a circle a perpendicular be drawn to any
chord, its square is equal to the rectangle contained by the perpendiculars from the extremities
of the chord on the tangent at P.
12. If O be the point of intersection of the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, the
four rectangles AB . BC, BD . CD, CD . DA, DA . AB, are proportional to the four lines BO,
CO, DO, AO.
13. The sum of the rectangles of the opposite sides of a
cyclic quadrilateral ABCD is equal to the rectangle contained
by its diagonals.
Dem.—Make the angle DAO = CAB; then the triangles
DAO, CAB are equiangular; therefore AD : DO :: AC : CB;
therefore AD . BC = AC . DO. Again, the triangles DAC,
OAB are equiangular, and CD : AC :: BO : AB; therefore
AC . CD = AC . BO. Hence AD . BC+AB . CD = AC . BD.
3
14. If the quadrilateral ABCD is not cyclic, prove that the
three rectangles AB . CD, BC . AD, AC . BD are proportional
to the three sides of a triangle which has an angle equal to
the sum of a pair of opposite angles of the quadrilateral.
15. Prove by using Theorem 11 that if perpendiculars be let fall on the sides and diagonals
of a cyclic quadrilateral, from any point in the circumference of the circumscribed circle, the
rectangle contained by the perpendiculars on the diagonals is equal to the rectangle contained
by the perpendiculars on either pair of opposite sides.
16. If AB be the diameter of a semicircle, and P A, P B chords from any point P in the
circumference, and if a perpendicular to AB from any point C meet P A, P B in D and E,
and the semicircle in F, CF is a mean proportional between CD and CE.
PROP. XVIII.—Problem.
On a given right line (AB) to construct a rectilineal figure similar to a given
one (CDEF G), and similarly placed as regards any side (CD) of the latter.
Def.—Similar figures are said to be similarly described upon given right
lines, when these lines are homologous sides of the figures.
Sol.—Join CE, CF, and construct a triangle ABH on AB equiangular to
CDE, and similarly placed as regards CD; that is, make, the angle ABH equal
to CDE, and BAH equal to DCE. In like manner construct the triangle HAI
3This Proposition is known as Ptolemy’s theorem.
149
equiangular to ECF, and similarly placed, and lastly, the triangle IAJ equiangular and similarly placed with F CG. Then ABHIJ is the figure required.
Dem.—From the construction it is evident that the figures are equiangular, and it is only required to prove that the sides about the equal angles
are proportional. Now because the triangle ABH is equiangular to CDE,
AB : BH :: CD : DE [iv.]; hence the sides about the equal angles B and D are
proportional. Again, from the same triangles we have BH : HA :: DE : EC,
and from the triangles IHA, F EC; HA : HI :: EC : EF; therefore (ex æquali)
BH : HI :: DE : EF; that is, the sides about the equal angles BHI, DEF are
proportional, and so in like manner are the sides about the other equal angles.
Hence (Def. i.) the figures are similar.
Observation.—In the foregoing construction, the line AB is homologous to CD, and it is
evident that we may take AB to be homologous to any other side of the given figure CDEF G.
Again, in each case, it the figure ABHIJ be turned round the line AB until it falls on the
other side, it will still be similar to the figure CDEF G. Hence on a given line AB there can
be constructed two figures each similar to a given figure CDEF G, and having the given line
AB homologous to any given side CD of the given figure.
The first of the figures thus constructed is said to be directly similar, and the second
inversely similar to the given figure. These technical terms are due to Hamilton: see “Elements
of Quaternions,” page 112.
Cor. 1.—Twice as many polygons may be constructed on AB similar to a
given polygon CDEF G as that figure has sides.
Cor. 2.—If the figure ABHIJ be applied to CDEF G so that the point A
will coincide with C, and that the line AB may be placed along CD, then the
points H, I, J will be respectively on the lines CE, CF, CG; also the sides BH,
HI, IJ of the one polygon will be respectively parallel to their homologous sides
DE, EF, F G of the other.
Cor. 3.—If lines drawn from any point O in the plane of a figure to all
its angular points be divided in the same ratio, the lines joining the points of
division will form a new figure similar to, and having every side parallel to, the
homologous side of the original.
PROP. XIX.—Theorem.
Similar triangles (ABC, DEF) have their areas to one another in the
duplicate ratio of their homologous sides.
Dem.—Take BG a third proportional to BC, EF [xi.]. Join AG.
Then because the triangles ABC,
DEF are similar, AB : BC :: DE :
EF; hence (alternately) AB : DE ::
BC : EF; but BC : EF :: EF : BG
(const.); therefore [V. xi.] AB :
DE :: EF : BG; hence the sides of
the triangles ABG, DEF about the
equal angles B, E are reciprocally proportional; therefore the triangles are equal.
150
Again, since the lines BC, EF, BG are continual proportionals, BC : BG in the
duplicate ratio of BC : EF [V. Def. x.]; but BC : BG :: triangle ABC : ABG.
Therefore ABC : ABG in the duplicate ratio of BC : EF; but it has been
proved that the triangle ABG is equal to DEF. Therefore the triangle ABC is
to the triangle DEF in the duplicate ratio of BC : EF.
This is the first Proposition in Euclid in which the technical term “duplicate
ratio” occurs. My experience with pupils is, that they find it very difficult to
understand either Euclid’s proof or his definition. On this account I submit the
following alternative proof, which, however, makes use of a new definition of the
duplicate ratio of two lines, viz. the ratio of the squares (see Annotations on
V. Def. x.) described on these lines.
On AB and DE describe squares, and through C and F draw lines parallel
to AB and DE, and complete the rectangles AI, DN.
Now, the triangles JAC, ODF are evidently equiangular.
Hence JA : AC :: OD : DF [iv.];
but AC : AB :: DF : DE [iv.].
Hence JA : AB :: OD : DE (ex æquali);
but AB = AG, and DE = DL;
therefore JA : AG :: OD : DL.
Again, JA : AG :: AI : square AH [i.],
and OD : DL :: DN : square DM [i.].
Hence AI : AH :: DN : DM;
therefore AI : DN :: AH : DM [V. xvi.];
hence 4ABC : 4DEF :: AB2
: DE2
.
151
Exercises.
1. If one of two similar triangles has its sides 50 per cent. longer than the homologous
sides of the other; what is the ratio of their areas?
2. When the inscribed and circumscribed regular polygons of any common number of sides
to a circle have more than four sides, the difference of their areas is less than the square of
the side of the inscribed polygon.
PROP. XX.—Theorem.
Similar polygons may be divided (1) into the same number of similar triangles; (2) the corresponding triangles have the same ratio to one another which
the polygons have; (3) the polygons are to each other in the duplicate ratio of
their homologous sides.
Dem.—Let ABHIJ, CDEF G be the polygons, and let the sides AB, CD
be homologous. Join AH, AI, CE, CF.
1. The triangles into which the polygons are divided are similar. For, since
the polygons are similar, they are equiangular, and have the sides about their
equal angles proportional [Def. i.]; hence the angle B is equal to D, and AB :
BH :: CD : DE; therefore [vi.] the triangle ABH is equiangular to CDE;
hence the angle BHA is equal to DEC; but BHI is equal to DEF (hyp.);
therefore the angle AHI is equal to CEF. Again, because the polygons are
similar, IH : HB :: F E : ED; and since the triangles ABH, CDE are similar,
HB : HA :: ED : EC; hence (ex aequali) IH : HA :: F E : EC, and the angle
IHA has been proved to be equal to the angle F EC; therefore the triangles
IHA, F EC are equiangular. In the same manner it can be proved that the
remaining triangles are equiangular.
2. Since the triangle ABH is similar to CDE, we have [xix.].
ABH : CDE in the duplicate ratio of AH : CE.
In like manner,
AHI : CEF in the duplicate ratio of AH : CE;
hence ABH : CDE = AHI : CEF [V. xi.].
Similarly, AHI : CEF = AIJ : CF G.
152
In these equal ratios, the triangles ABH, AHI, AIJ are the antecedents, and
the triangles CDE, CEF, CF G the consequents, and [V. xii.] any one of these
equal ratios is equal to the ratio of the sum of all the antecedents to the sum
of all the consequents; therefore the triangle ABH : the triangle CDE :: the
polygon ABHIJ : the polygon CDEF G.
3. The triangle ABH : CDE in the duplicate ratio of AB : CD [xix.].
Hence (2) the polygon ABHIJ : the polygon CDEF G in the duplicate ratio of
AB : CD.
Cor. 1.—The perimeters of similar polygons are to one another in the ratio
of their homologous sides.
Cor. 2.—As squares are similar polygons, therefore the duplicate ratio of
two lines is equal to the ratio of the squares described on them (compare Annotations, V. Def. x.).
Cor. 3.—Similar portions of similar figures bear the same ratio to each other
as the wholes of the figures.
Cor. 4.—Similar portions of the perimeters of similar figures are to each
other in the ratio of the whole perimeters.
Exercises.
Def. i.—Homologous points in the planes of two similar figures are such, that
lines drawn from them to the angular points of the two figures are proportional
to the homologous sides of the two figures.
1. If two figures be similar, to each
point in the plane of one there will be a
corresponding point in the plane of the
other.
Dem.—Let ABCD, A0B0C0D0 be
the two figures, P a point in the plane
of ABCD. Join AP, BP, and construct a triangle A0P
0B0 on A0B0
, similar to AP B; then it is easy to see that
lines from P
0
to the angular points of
A0B0C0D0 are proportional to the lines
from P to the angular points of ABCD.
2. If two figures be directly similar, and
in the same plane, there is in the plane a special point which, regarded as belonging to either figure, is its own homologous point with
respect to the other. For, let AB, A0B0 be
two homologous sides of the figures, C their
point of intersection. Through the two triads
of points A, A0
, C; B, B0
, C describe two circles intersecting again in the point O: O will
be the point required. For it is evident that
the triangles OAB, OA0B0 are similar and
that either may be turned round the point
O, so that the two bases, AB, A0B0
, will be parallel.
Def. ii.—The point O is called the centre of similitude of the figures. It is
also called their double point.
3. Two regular polygons of n sides each have n centres of similitude.
153
4. If any number of similar triangles have their corresponding vertices lying on three given
lines, they have a common centre of similitude.
5. If two figures be directly similar, and have a pair of homologous sides parallel, every
pair of homologous sides will be parallel.
Def. iii.—Two figures, such as those in 5, are said to be homothetic.
6. If two figures be homothetic, the lines joining corresponding angular points are concurrent, and the point of concurrence is the centre of similitude of the figures.
7. If two polygons be directly similar, either may be turned round their centre of similitude
until they become homothetic, and this may be done in two different ways.
8. Two circles are similar figures.
Dem.—Let O, O0 be
their centres; let the angle
AOB be indefinitely small,
so that the arc AB may
be regarded as a right line;
make the angle A0O0B0
equal to AOB; then the triangles AOB, A0O0B0 are
similar.
Again, make the angle BOC indefinitely small,
and make B0O0C0 equal to
it; the triangles BOC, B0O0C0 are similar. Proceeding in this way, we see that the circles can
be divided into the same number of similar elementary triangles. Hence the circles are similar
figures.
9. Sectors of circles having equal central angles are similar figures.
10. As any two points of two circles may be regarded as homologous, two circles have
in consequence an infinite number of centres of similitude; their locus is the circle, whose
diameter is the line joining the two points for which the two circles are homothetic.
11. The areas of circles are to one another as the squares of their diameters. For they are
to one another as the similar elementary triangles into which they are divided, and these are
as the squares of the radii.
12. The circumferences of circles are as their diameters (Cor. 1).
13. The circumference of sectors having equal central angles are proportional to their radii.
Hence if a, a
0 denote the arcs of two sectors, which subtend equal angles at the centres, and
if r, r
0 be their radii,
a
r
=
a
0
r
0
.
14. The area of a circle is equal to half the rectangle contained by the circumference and
the radius. This is evident by dividing the circle into elementary triangles, as in Ex. 8.
15. The area of a sector of a circle is equal to half the rectangle contained by the arc of
the sector and the radius of the circle.
PROP. XXI.—Theorem.
Rectilineal figures (A, B), which are similar to the same figure (C), are
similar to one another.
Dem.—Since the figures A and C are similar, they are equiangular, and
have the sides about their equal angles proportional. In like manner B and
C are equiangular, and have the sides about their equal angles proportional.
Hence A and B are equiangular, and have the sides about their equal angles
proportional. Therefore they are similar.
154
Cor.—Two similar rectilineal figures which are homothetic to a third are
homothetic to one another.
Exercise.
If three similar rectilineal figures be homothetic, two by two, their three centres of similitudes are collinear.
PROP. XXII—Theorem.
If four lines (AB, CD, EF, GH) be proportional, and any pair of similar
rectilineal figures (ABK, CDL) be similarly described on the first and second,
and also any pair (EI, GJ) on the third and fourth, these figures are proportional. Conversely, if any rectilineal figure described on the first of four right
lines: the similar and similarly described figure described on the second :: any
rectilineal figure on the third : the similar and similarly described figure on the
fourth, the four lines are proportional.
Dem. 1.—ABK : CDL :: AB2
: CD2
. [xx.];
and EI : GJ :: EF2
: GH2
[xx.].
But since AB : CD :: EF : GH,
AB2
: CD2
:: EF2
: GH2
[V. xxii., Cor. 1];
therefore ABK : CDL :: EI : GJ.
If ABK : CDL :: EI : GJ, AB : CD :: EF : GH.
Dem. 2.—ABK : CDL :: AB2
: CD2
[xx.],
and EI : GJ :: EF2
: GH2
[xx.];
therefore AB2
: CD2
:: EF2
: GH2
.
Hence AB : CD :: EF : GH.
155
The enunciation of this Proposition is wrongly stated in Simson’s Euclid,
and in those that copy it. As given in those works, the four figures should be
similar.
PROP. XXIII.—Theorem.
Equiangular parallelograms (AD, CG) are to each other as the rectangles
contained by their sides about a pair of equal angles.
Dem.—Let the two sides AB, BC about the
equal angles ABD, CBG, be placed so as to form
one right line; then it is evident, as in Prop. xiv.,
that GB, BD form one right line. Complete the
parallelogram BF. Now, denoting the parallelograms AB, BF, CG by X, Y , Z, respectively, we
have—
X : Y :: AB : BC [i.],
Y : Z :: BD : BG [i.].
Hence XY : Y Z :: AB . BD : BC . BG;
or X : Z :: AB . BD : BC . BG.
Observation.—Since AB . BD : BC . BG is compounded of the two ratios AB : BC and
BD : BG [V. Def. of compound ratio], the enunciation is the same as if we said, “in the ratio
compounded of the ratios of the sides,” which is Euclid’s; but it is more easily understood as
we have put it.
Exercises.
1. Triangles which have one angle of one equal or supplemental to one angle of the other,
are to one another in the ratio of the rectangles of the sides about those angles.
2. Two quadrilaterals whose diagonals intersect at equal angles are to one another in the
ratio of the rectangles of the diagonals.
PROP. XXIV.—Theorem.
In any parallelogram (AC), every two parallelograms (AF, F C) which are
about a diagonal are similar to the whole and to one another.
Dem.—Since the parallelograms AC, AF have a common angle, they are equiangular [I. xxxiv.], and all that
is required to be proved is, that the sides about the equal
angles are proportional. Now, since the lines EF, BC are
parallel, the triangles AEF, ABC are equiangular; therefore [iv.] AE : EF :: AB : BC, and the other sides of the
parallelograms are equal to AE, EF; AB, BC: hence the
sides about the equal angles are proportional; therefore the
parallelograms AF, AC are similar. In the same manner the parallelograms AF,
F C are similar.
Cor.—The parallelograms AF, F C, AC are, two by two, homothetic.
156
PROP. XXV.—Problem.
To describe a rectilineal figure equal to a given one (A), and similar to another
given one (BCD).
Sol.—On any side BC of the figure BCD describe the rectangle BE equal to
BCD [I. xlv.], and on CE describe the rectangle EF equal to A. Between BC,
CF find a mean proportional GH, and on it describe the figure GHI similar
to BCD [xviii.], so that BC and GH may be homologous sides. GHI is the
figure required.
Dem.—The three lines BC, GH, CF are in continued proportion; therefore
BC : CF in the duplicate ratio of BC : GH [V. Def. x.]; and since the figures
BCD, GHI are similar, BCD : GHI in the duplicate ratio of BC : GH [xx.];
also BC : CF :: rectangle BE : rectangle EF. Hence rectangle BE : EF ::
figure BCD : GHI; but the rectangle BE is equal to the figure BCD; therefore
the rectangle EF is equal to the figure GHI; but EF is equal to A (const.).
Therefore the figure GHI is equal to A, and it is similar to BCD. Hence it is
the figure required.
157
Or thus: Describe the squares EF JK, LMNO equal to the figures BCD and A respectively [II. xiv.]; then find GH a fourth proportional to EF, LM, and BC [xii.]. On GH
describe the rectilineal figure GHI similar to the figure BCD [xviii.], so that BC and GH
may be homologous sides. GHI is the figure required.
Dem.—Because EF : LM :: BC : GH (const.), the figure EF JK : LMNO :: BCD :
GHI [xxii.]; but EF JK is equal to BCD (const.); therefore LMNO is equal to GHI; but
LMNO is equal to A (const.). Therefore GHI is equal to A, and it is similar to BCD.
PROP. XXVI.—Theorem.
If two similar and similarly situated parallelograms (AEF G, ABCD) have a
common angle, they are about the same diagonal.
Dem.—Draw the diagonals (see fig., Prop. xxiv.) AF, AC. Then because
the parallelograms AEF G, ABCD are similar figures, they can be divided into
the same number of similar triangles [xx.]. Hence the triangle F AG is similar
to CAD, and therefore the angle F AG is equal to the angle CAD. Hence the
line AC must pass through the point F, and therefore the parallelograms are
about the same diagonal.
Observation.—Proposition xxvi., being the converse of xxiv., has evidently been misplaced. The following would be a simpler enunciation:—“If two homothetic parallelograms
have a common angle, they are about the same diagonal.”
PROP. XXVII—Problem.
To inscribe in a given triangle (ABC) the maximum parallelogram having a
common angle (B) with the triangle.
Sol.—Bisect the side AC opposite to the angle B, at P : through P draw
P E, P F parallel to the other sides of the triangle. BP is the parallelogram
required.
Dem.—Take any other point D in AC :
draw DG, DH parallel to the sides, and CK
parallel to AB; produce EP, GD to meet CK
in K and J, and produce HD to meet PK
in I.
Now, since AC is bisected in P, EK is
also bisected in P; hence [I. xxxvi.] the parallelogram EO is equal to OK; therefore EO
is greater than DK; but DK is equal to F D [I. xliii.]; hence EO is greater
than F D. To each add BO, and we have the parallelogram BP greater than
BD. Hence BP is the maximum parallelogram which can be inscribed in the
given triangle.
Cor. 1.—The maximum parallelogram exceeds any other parallelogram about the same angle in the triangle, by the area of the similar parallelogram
whose diagonal is the line between the middle point P of the opposite side and
the point D, which is the corner of the other inscribed parallelogram.
158
Cor. 2.—The parallelograms inscribed in a triangle, and having one angle
common with it, are proportional to the rectangles contained by the segments
of the sides of the triangle, made by the opposite corners of the parallelograms.
Cor. 3.—The parallelogram AC : GH :: AC2
: AD . DC.
PROP. XXVIII.—Problem.
To inscribe in a given triangle (ABC) a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure (X) not greater than the maximum inscribed parallelogram, and
having an angle (B) common with the triangle.
Sol.—Bisect the side AC opposite to B, at P. Draw P F, P E parallel to the
sides AB, BC; then [xxvii.] BP is the maximum parallelogram that can be
inscribed in the triangle ABC; and if X be equal to it, the problem is solved. If
not, produce EP, and draw CJ parallel to P F; then describe the parallelogram
KLMN [xxv.] equal to the difference between the figure P JCF and X, and
similar to P JCF, and so that the sides P J and KL will be homologous; then
cut off P I equal to KL; draw IH parallel to AB, cutting AC in D, and draw
DG parallel to BC. BD is the parallelogram required.
Dem.—Since the parallelograms P C, P D are about the same diagonal, they
are similar [xxiv.]; but P C is similar to KP T (const.); therefore P D is similar
to KN, and (const.) their homologous sides, P I and KL, are equal; hence [xx.]
P D is equal to KN. Now, P D is the difference between EF and GH [xxvii.
Cor. 1], and KN is (const.) the difference between P C and X; therefore the
difference between P C and X is equal to the difference between EF and GH;
but EF is equal to P C. Hence GH is equal to X.
PROP. XXIX.—Problem.
To escribe to a given triangle (ABC) a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure (X), and having an angle common with an external angle (B) of
the triangle.
159
Sol.—The construction is the same as the last, except that, instead of making the parallelogram KN equal to the excess of the parallelogram P C over the
rectilineal figure X, we make it equal to their sum; and then make P I equal to
KL; draw IH parallel to AB, and the rest of the construction as before.
Dem.—Now it can be proved, as in II. vi., that the parallelogram BD is
equal to the gnomon OHJ; that is, equal to the difference between the parallelograms P D and P C, or the difference (const.) between KN and P C; that is
(const.), equal to X, and BD is escribed to the triangle ABC, and has an angle
common with the external angle B. Hence the thing required is done.
Observation.—The enunciations of the three foregoing Propositions have been altered, in
order to express them in modern technical language. Some writers recommend the student to
omit them—we think differently. In the form we have given them they are freed from their
usual repulsive appearance. The constructions and demonstrations are Euclid’s, but slightly
modified.
PROP. XXX.—Theorem.
To divide a given line (AB) in “extreme and mean ratio.”
Sol.—Divide AB in C, so that the rectangle AB . BC may be equal to the
square on AC [II. xi.] Then C is the point required.
Dem.—Because the rectangle AB . BC is equal
to the square on AC, AB : AC :: AC : BC [xvii.].
Hence AB is cut in extreme and mean ratio in C [Def. ii.].
Exercises.
1. If the three sides of a right-angled triangle be in continued proportion, the hypotenuse
is divided in extreme and mean ratio by the perpendicular from the right angle on the hypotenuse.
2. In the same case the greater segment of the hypotenuse is equal to the least side of the
triangle.
3. The square on the diameter of the circle described about the triangle formed by the
points F, H, D (see fig. II. xi.), is equal to six times the square on the line F D.
160
PROP. XXXI.—Theorem.
If any similar rectilineal figure be similarly described on the three sides of a
right-angled triangle (ABC), the figure on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of
those described on the two other sides.
Dem.—Draw the perpendicular CD [I. xii.]. Then because ABC is a rightangled triangle, and CD is drawn from the right angle perpendicular to the
hypotenuse; BD : AD in the duplicate ratio of BA : AC [viii. Cor. 4]. Again,
because the figures described on BA, AC are similar, they are in the duplicate
ratio of BA : AC [xx.]. Hence [V. xi.] BA : AD :: figure described on BA :
figure described on AC. In like manner, AB : BD :: figure described on AB :
figure described on BC. Hence [V. xxiv.] AB : sum of AD and BD :: figure
described on the line AB : sum of the figures described on the lines AC, BC; but
AB is equal to the sum of AD and BD. Therefore [V. a.] the figure described
on the line AB is equal to the sum of the similar figures described on the lines
AC and BC.
Or thus: Let us denote the sides by
a, b, c, and the figures by ?, ?, ?; then
because the figures are similar, we have
[xx.]
? : ? :: a
2
: c
2
therefore ?
?
=
a
2
c
2
.
In like manner, ?
?
=
b
2
c
2
;
therefore ? + ?
?
=
a
2 + b
2
c
2
;
but a
2 + b
2 = c
2
[I. xlvii.]. Therefore ? + ? = ?; that is, the sum of the figures
on the sides is equal to the figure on the hypotenuse.
Exercise.
If semicircles be described on supplemental chords of a semicircle, the sum of the areas
of the two crescents thus formed is equal to the area of the triangle whose sides are the
supplemental chords and the diameter.
PROP. XXXII.—Theorem.
If two triangles (ABC, CDE) which have two sides of one proportional to
two sides of the other (AB : BC :: CD : DE), and the contained angles (B, D)
equal, be joined at an angle (C), so as to have their homologous sides parallel,
the remaining sides are in the same right line.
161
Dem.—Because the triangles ABC, CDE
have the angles B and D equal, and the sides
about these angles proportional, viz., AB :
BC :: CD : DE, they are equiangular [vi.];
therefore the angle BAC is equal to DCE. To
each add ACD, and we have the sum of the angles BAC, ACD equal to the sum of DCE and
ACD; but the sum of BAC, ACD is [I. xxix.] two right angles; therefore the
sum of DCE and ACD is two right angles. Hence [I. xiv.] AC, CE are in the
same right line.
PROP. XXXIII.–Theorem.
In equal circles, angles (BOC, EP F) at the centres or (BAC, EDF) at the
circumferences have the same ratio to one another as the arcs (BC, EF) on
which they stand, and so also have the sectors (BOC, EP F).
Dem.—1. Take any number of arcs CG, GH in the first circle, each equal
to BC. Join OG, OH, and in the second circle take any number of arcs F I,
IJ, each equal to EF. Join IP, JP. Then because the arcs BC, CG, GH are
all equal, the angles BOC, COG, GOH, are all equal [III. xxvii.]. Therefore
the arc BH and the angle BOH are equimultiples of the arc BC and the angle
BOC. In like manner it may be proved that the arc EJ and the angle EP J are
equimultiples of the arc EF and the angle EP F. Again, since the circles are
equal, it is evident that the angle BOH is greater than, equal to, or less than
the angle EP J, according as the arc BH is greater than, equal to, or less than
the arc EJ. Now we have four magnitudes, namely, the arc BC, the arc EF,
the angle BOC, and the angle EP F; and we have taken equimultiples of the
first and third, namely, the arc BH, the angle BOH, and other equimultiples
of the second and fourth, namely, the arc EJ and the angle EP J, and we have
proved that, according as the multiple of the first is greater than, equal to, or
less than the multiple of the second, the multiple of the third is greater than,
equal to, or less than the multiple of the fourth. Hence [V. Def. v.] BC : EF ::
the angle BOC : EP F.
162
Again, since the angle BAC is half the angle BOC [III. xx.], and EDF is
half the angle EP F,
BAC : EDF :: BOC : EP F [V. xv.];
but BOC : EP F :: BC : EF.
Hence BAC : EDF :: BC : EF [V. xi.].
2. The sector BOC : sector EP F :: BC : EF.
Dem.—The same construction being made, since the arc BC is equal to CG,
the angle BOC is equal to COG. Hence the sectors BOC, COG are congruent
(see Observation, Proposition xxix., Book III.); therefore they are equal. In
like manner the sectors COG, GOH are equal. Hence there are as many equal
sectors as there are equal arcs; therefore the arc BH and the sector BOH are
equimultiples of the arc BC and the sector BOC. In the same manner it may
be proved that the arc EJ and the sector EP J are equimultiples of the arc EF
and the sector EP F; and it is evident, by superposition, that if the arc BH is
greater than, equal to, or less than the arc EJ, the sector BOH is greater than,
equal to, or less than the sector EP J. Hence [V. Def. v.] the arc BC : EF ::
sector BOC : sector EP F.
The second part may be proved as follows:—
Sector BOC = 1
2
rectangle contained by the arc BC, and the radius of the circle ABC
[xx. Ex. 14] and sector EP F = 1
2
rectangle contained by the arc EF and the radius of the
circle EDF; and since the circles are equal, their radii are equal. Hence, sector BOC : sector
EP F :: arc BC : arc EF.

THEORY OF PLANES, COPLANAR LINES, AND SOLID
ANGLES
DEFINITIONS.
i. When two or more lines are in one plane they are said to be coplanar .
ii. The angle which one plane makes with another is called a dihedral angle.
iii. A solid angle is that which is made by more than two plane angles, in
different planes, meeting in a point.
iv. The point is called the vertex of the solid angle.
v. If a solid angle be composed of three plane angles it is called a trihedral
angle; if of four, a tetrahedral angle; and if of more than four, a polyhedral angle.
PROP. I.—Theorem.
One part (AB) of a right line cannot be in a plane (X), and another part
(BC) not in it.
Dem.—Since AB is in the plane X, it
can be produced in it [Bk. I. Post. ii.]; let
it be produced to D. Then, if BC be not in
X, let any other plane passing through AD
be turned round AD until it passes through
the point C. Now, because the points B,
C are in this second plane, the line BC [I., Def. vi.] is in it. Therefore the two
right lines ABC, ABD lying in one plane have a common segment AB, which
is impossible. Therefore, &c.
PROP. II.—Theorem.
Two right lines (AB, CD) which intersect one
another in any point (E) are coplanar, and so also
are any three right lines (EC, CB, BE) which
form a triangle.
Dem.—Let any plane pass through EB, and
be turned round it until it passes through C. Then
because the points E, C are in this plane, the right
line EC is in it [I., Def. vi.]. For the same reason
the line BC is in it. Therefore the lines EC, CB,
BE are coplanar; but AB and CD are two of these lines. Hence AB and CD
are coplanar.
171
PROP. III.—Theorem.
If two planes (AB, BC) cut one another, their common section (BD) is a
right line.
Dem.—If not from B to D, draw in the
plane AB the right line BED, and in the plane
BC the right line BF D. Then the right lines
BED, BF D enclose a space, which [I., Axiom x.] is impossible. Therefore the common
section BD of the two planes must be a right
line.
PROP. IV.—Theorem.
If a right line (EF) be perpendicular to each of two intersecting lines (AB,
CD), it will be perpendicular to any line GH, which is both coplanar and concurrent with them.
Dem.—Through any point G in GH draw a line BC intersecting AB, CD,
and so as to be bisected in G; and join any point F in EF to B, G, C. Then,
because EF is perpendicular to the lines EB, EC, we have
BF2 = BE2 + EF2
, and CF2 = CE2 + EF2
;
? BF2 + CF2 = BE2 + CE2 + 2EF2
.
Again BF2 + CF2 = 2BG2 + 2GF2
[II. x. Ex. 2],
and BE2 + CE2 = 2BG2 + 2GE2
;
? 2BG2 + 2GF2 = 2BG2 + 2GE2 + 2EF2
;
? GF2 = GE2 + EF2
.
172
Hence the angle GEF is right, and EF is perpendicular to EG.
Def. vi.—A line such as EF, which is perpendicular to a system of concurrent and coplanar lines, is said to be perpendicular to the plane of these lines,
and is called a normal to it.
Cor. 1.—The normal is the least line that may be drawn from a given point
to a given plane; and of all others that may be drawn to it, the lines of any
system making equal angles with the normal are equal to each other.
Cor. 2.—A perpendicular to each of two intersecting lines is normal to their
plane.
PROP. V.—Theorem.
If three concurrent lines (BC, BD, BE) have a
common perpendicular (AB), they are coplanar.
Dem.—For if possible let BC be not coplanar with
BD, BE, and let the plane of AB, BC intersect the
plane of BD, BE in the line BF. Then [XI. iii.] BF
is a right line; and, since it is coplanar with BD, BE,
which are each perpendicular to AB, it is [XI. iv.]
perpendicular to AB. Therefore the angle ABF is
right; and the angle ABC is right (hyp.). Hence ABC
is equal to ABF, which is impossible [I., Axiom ix.].
Therefore the lines BC, BD, BE are coplanar.
PROP. VI.—Theorem.
If two right lines (AB, CD) be normals to the same plane (X), they shall be
parallel to one another.
Dem.—Let AB, CD meet the plane X at the points
B, D. Join BD, and in the plane X draw DE at right
angles to BD; take any point E in DE. Join BE, AE,
AD. Then because AB is normal to X, the angle ABE
is right. Therefore AE2 = AB2 +BE2 = AB2 +BD2 +
DE2
; because the angle BDE is right. But AB2 +
BD2 = AD2
, because the angle ABD is right. Hence
AE2 = AD2 + DE2
. Therefore the angle ADE is right.
[I. xlviii]. And since CD is normal to the plane X,
DE is perpendicular to CD. Hence DE is a common
perpendicular to the three concurrent lines CD, AD,
BD. Therefore these lines are coplanar [XI. v.]. But AB is coplanar with AD,
BD [XI. ii.]. Therefore the lines AD, BD, CD are coplanar; and since the
angles ABD, BDC are right, the line AB is parallel to CD [I. xxviii.].
Def. vii.—If from every point in a given line normals be drawn to a given
plane, the locus of their feet is called the projection of the given line on the
plane.
173
Exercises.
1. The projection of any line on a plane is a right line.
2. The projection on either of two intersecting planes of a normal to the other plane is
perpendicular to the line of intersection of the planes.
PROP. VII.—Theorem.
Two parallel lines (AB, CD) and any line (EF) intersecting them are
coplanar.
Dem.—If possible let the intersecting
line be out of the plane, as EGF. And in
the plane, of the parallels draw [I. Post. ii.]
the right line EHF. Then we have two
right lines EGF, EHF, enclosing a space,
which [I. Axiom x.] is impossible. Hence
the two parallel right lines and the transversal are coplanar.
Or thus: Since the points E, F are in the plane of the parallels, the line joining these
points is in that plane [I. Def. vi].
PROP. VIII.—Theorem.
If one (AB) of two parallel right lines (AB, CD), be normal to a plane (X),
the other line (CD) shall be normal to the same plane.
Dem.—Let AB, CD meet the plane X in the
points B, D. Join BD. Then the lines AB, BD,
CD are coplanar. Now in the plane X, to which AB
is normal, draw DE at right angles to BD. Take any
point E in DE, and join BE, AE, AD.
Then because AB is normal to the plane X, it
is perpendicular to the line BE in that plane [XI.
Def. vi.]. Hence the angle ABE is right; therefore
AE2 = AB2 + BE2 = AB2 + BD2 + DE2
(because
BDE is right (const.)) = AD2 + DE2
(because ABD
is right (hyp.)). Therefore the angle ADE is right.
Hence DE is at right angles both to AD and BD. Therefore [XI. iv.] DE
is perpendicular to CD, which is coplanar and concurrent with AD and BD.
Again, since AB and CD are parallel, the sum of the angles ABD, BDC is
two right angles [I. xxix.]; but ABD is right (hyp.); therefore BDC is right.
Hence CD is perpendicular to the two lines DB, DE, and therefore [XI. iv.] it
is normal to their plane, that is, it is normal to X.
174
PROP. IX—Theorem.
Two right lines (AB, CD) which are each parallel to a third line (EF) are
parallel to one another.
Dem.—If the three lines be coplanar, the
Proposition is evidently the same as I. xxx.
If they are not coplanar, from any point G in
EF draw in the planes of EF, AB; EF, CD,
respectively, the lines GH, GK each perpendicular to EF [I. xi.]. Then because EF is
perpendicular to each of the lines GH, GK, it
is normal to their plane [XI. iv.]. And because AB is parallel to EF (hyp.), and
EF is normal to the plane GHK, AB is normal to the plane GHK [XI. viii.].
In like manner CD is normal to the plane HGK. Hence, since AB and CD are
normals to the same plane, they are parallel to one another.
PROP. X.—Theorem.
If two intersecting right lines (AB, BC) be respectively parallel to two other
intersecting right lines (DE, EF), the angle (ABC) between the former is equal
to the angle (DEF) between the latter.
Dem.—If both pairs of lines be coplanar, the
proposition is the same as I. xxix., Ex. 2. If not,
take any points A, C in the lines AB, BC, and cut
off ED = BA, and EF = BC [I. iii.]. Join AD,
BE, CF, AC, DF. Then because AB is equal
and parallel to DE, AD is equal and parallel to
BE [I. xxxiii]. In like manner CF is equal and
parallel to BE. Hence [XI. ix.] AD is equal and
parallel to CF. Hence [I. xxxiii.] AC is equal to
DF. Therefore the triangles ABC, DEF, have
the three sides of one respectively equal to the three sides of the other. Hence
[I. viii.] the angle ABC is equal to DEF.
Def. viii.—Two planes which meet are perpendicular to each other, when
the right lines drawn in one of them perpendicular to their common section are
normals to the other.
Def. ix.—When two planes which meet are not perpendicular to each other,
their inclination is the acute angle contained by two right lines drawn from any
point of their common section at right angles to it—one in one plane, and the
other in the other.
Observation.—These definitions tacitly assume the result of Props. iii. and x. of this book.
On this account we have departed from the usual custom of placing them at the beginning of
the book. We have altered the place of Definition vi. for a similar reason.
175
PROP. XI.—Problem.
To draw a normal to a given plane (BH) from a given point (A) not in it.
Sol.—In the given plane BH draw any
line BC, and from A draw AD perpendicular to BC [I. xii.]; then if AD be perpendicular to the plane, the thing required is
done. If not, from D draw DE in the plane
BH at right angles to BC [I. xi.], and from
A draw AF [I. xii.] perpendicular to DE.
AF is normal to the plane BH.
Dem.—Draw GH parallel to BC.
Then because BC is perpendicular both to ED and DA, it is normal to the
plane of ED, DA [XI. iv.]; and since GH is parallel to BC, it is normal to the
same plane [XI. viii.]. Hence AF is perpendicular to GH [XI. Def. vi.], and AF
is perpendicular to DE (const.). Therefore AF is normal to the plane of GH
and ED—that is, to the plane BH.
PROP. XII.—Problem.
To draw a normal to a given plane from
a given point (A) in the plane.
Sol.—From any point B not in the
plane draw [XI. xi.] BC normal to it. If
this line pass through A it is the normal
required. If not, from A draw AD parallel
to BC [I. xxxi.]. Then because AD and
BC are parallel, and BC is normal to the
plane, AD is also normal to it [XI. viii.],
and it is drawn from the given point. Hence
it is the required normal.
PROP. XIII.—Theorem.
From the same point (A) there can be
but one normal drawn to a given plane
(X).
Dem.—1. Let A be in the given plane,
and if possible let AB, AC be both normals
to it, on the same side. Now let the plane
of BA, AC cut the given plane X in the
line DE. Then because BA is a normal,
the angle BAE is right. In like manner CAE is right. Hence BAE = CAE,
which is impossible.
176
2. If the point be above the plane, there can be but one normal; for, if there
could be two, they would be parallel [XI. vi.] to one another, which is absurd.
Therefore from the same point there can be drawn but one normal to a given
plane.
PROP. XIV.—Theorem.
Planes (CD, EF) which have a common normal (AB) are parallel to each
other.
Dem.—If the planes be not parallel,
they will meet when produced. Let them
meet, their common section being the line
GH, in which take any point K. Join
AK, BK. Then because AB is normal
to the plane CD, it is perpendicular to
the line AK, which it meets in that plane
[XI. Def. vi.]. Therefore the angle BAK
is right. In like manner the angle ABK
is right. Hence the plane triangle ABK
has two right angles, which is impossible. Therefore the planes CD, EF cannot
meet—that is, they are parallel.
Exercises.
1. The angle between two planes is equal to the angle between two intersecting normals
to these planes.
2. If a line be parallel to each of two planes, the sections which any plane passing through
it makes with them are parallel.
3. If a line be parallel to each of two intersecting planes, it is parallel to their intersection.
4. If two right lines be parallel, they are parallel to the common section of any two planes
passing through them.
5. If the intersections of several planes be parallel, the normals drawn to them from any
point are coplanar.
PROP. XV.—Theorem.
Two planes (AC, DF) are parallel, if two intersecting lines (AB, BC) on
one of them be respectively parallel to two intersecting lines (DE, EF) on the
other.
Dem.—From B draw BG perpendicular to the plane DF [XI. xi.], and let
it meet that plane in G. Through G draw GH parallel to ED, and GK to EF.
Now, since GH is parallel to ED (const.), and AB to ED (hyp.), AB is parallel
to GH [XI. ix.]. Hence the sum of the angles ABG, BGH is two right angles
[I. xxix]; but BGH is right (const.); therefore ABG is right. In like manner
177
CBG is right. Hence BG is normal to the plane AC [XI. Def. vi.], and it is
normal to DF (const.). Hence the planes AC, DF have a common normal BG;
therefore they are parallel to one another.
PROP. XVI.—Theorem.
If two parallel planes (AB, CD)
be cut by a third plane (EF, HG),
their common sections (EF, GH)
with it are parallel.
Dem.—If the lines EF, GH are
not parallel, they must meet at some
finite distance. Let them meet in K.
Now since K is a point in the line
EF, and EF is in the plane AB, K
is in the plane AB. In like manner
K is a point in the plane CD. Hence
the planes AB, CD meet in K, which
is impossible, since they are parallel.
Therefore the lines EF, GH must be
parallel.
Exercises.
1. Parallel planes intercept equal segments on parallel lines.
2. Parallel lines intersecting the same plane make equal angles with it.
3. A right line intersecting parallel planes makes equal angles with them.
PROP. XVII.—Theorem.
If two parallel lines (AB, CD) be cut by three parallel planes (GH, KL,
MN) in two triads of points (A, E, B; C, F, D), their segments between
those points are proportional.
178
Dem.—Join AC, BD, AD. Let AD meet
the plane KL in X. Join EX, XF. Then because the parallel planes KL, MN are cut by
the plane ABD in the lines EX, BD, these lines
are parallel [XI. xvi.]. Hence
AE : EB :: AX : XD [VI. ii.].
In like manner,
AX : XD :: CF : F D.
Therefore [V. xi.]
AE : EB :: CF : F D.
PROP. XVIII.—Theorem.
If a right line (AB) be normal to a plane (CI), any plane (DE) passing
through it shall be perpendicular to that plane.
Dem.—Let CE be the common section of the planes DE, CI. From any
point F in CE draw F G in the plane
DE parallel to AB [I. xxxi.]. Then because AB and F G are parallel, but AB
is normal, to the plane CI; hence F G is
normal to it [XI. viii.]. Now since F G is
parallel to AB, the angles ABF, BF G
are equal to two right angles [I. xxix.];
but ABF is right (hyp.); therefore BF G is right—that is, F G is perpendicular
to CE. Hence every line in the plane DE, drawn perpendicular to the common section of the planes DE, CI, is normal to the plane CI. Therefore [XI.
Def. viii.] the planes DE, CI are perpendicular to each other.
PROP. XIX.—Theorem.
If two intersecting planes (AB, BC) be each
perpendicular to a third plane (ADC), their common section (BD) shall be normal to that plane.
Dem.—If not, draw from D in the plane AB
the line DE perpendicular to AD, the common section of the planes AB, ADC; and in the plane BC
draw BF perpendicular to the common section DC
of the planes BC, ADC. Then because the plane
AB is perpendicular to ADC, the line DE in AB
179
is normal to the plane ADC [XI. Def. viii.]. In like
manner DF is normal to it. Therefore from the point D there are two distinct
normals to the plane ADC, which [XI. xiii.] is impossible. Hence BD must be
normal to the plane ADC.
Exercises.
1. If three planes have a common line of intersection, the normals drawn to these planes
from any point of that line are coplanar.
2. If two intersecting planes be respectively perpendicular to two intersecting lines, the
line of intersection of the former is normal to the plane of the latter.
3. In the last case, show that the dihedral angle between the planes is equal to the
rectilineal angle between the normals.
PROP. XX.—Theorem.
The sum of any two plane angles (BAD, DAC) of a trihedral angle (A) is
greater than the third (BAC).
Dem.—If the third angle BAC be less
than or equal to either of the other angles
the proposition is evident. If not, suppose
it greater: take any point D in AD, and
at the point A in the plane BAC make the
angle BAE equal BAD [I. xxiii.], and cut
off AE equal AD. Through E draw BC,
cutting AB, AC in the points B, C. Join
DB, DC.
Then the triangles BAD, BAE have the two sides BA, AD in one equal
respectively to the two sides BA, AE in the other, and the angle BAD equal
to BAE; therefore the third side BD is equal to BE. But the sum of the sides
BD, DC is greater than BC; hence DC is greater than EC. Again, because
the triangles DAC, EAC have the sides DA, AC respectively equal to the sides
EA, AC in the other, but the base DC greater than EC; therefore [I. xxv.] the
angle DAC is greater than EAC, but the angle DAB is equal to BAE (const.).
Hence the sum of the angles BAD, DAC is greater than the angle BAC.
PROP. XXI.—Theorem.
The sum of all the plane angles (BAC,
CAD, &c.) forming any solid angle (A) is less
than four right angles.
Dem.—Suppose for simplicity that the solid
angle A is contained by five plane angles BAC,
CAD, DAE, EAF, F AB; and let the planes of
these angles be cut by another plane in the lines
BC, CD, DE, EF, F B; then we have [XI. xx.],
180
?ABC + ABF greater than F BC,
?ACB + ACD ,, BCD, &c.
Hence, adding, we get the sum of the base angles of the five triangles BAC,
CAD, &c., greater than the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon BCDEF
—that is, greater than six right angles. But the sum of the base angles of the
same triangles, together with the sum of the plane angles BAC, CAD, &c.,
forming the solid angle A, is equal to twice as many right angles as there are
triangles BAC, CAD, &c.—that is, equal to ten right angles. Hence the sum
of the angles forming the solid angle is less than four right angles.
Observation.—This Prop. may not hold if the polygonal base BCDEF contain re-entrant
angles.
Exercises on Book XI.
1. Any face angle of a trihedral angle is less than the sum, but greater than the difference,
of the supplements of the other two face angles.

5. If two of the plane angles of a tetrahedral angle be equal, the planes of these angles

trihedral angle be equally inclined to the third plane, the angles contained in those planes are
equal.

to the angle, the sum of the rectilineal angles DOA, DOB, DOC is less than the sum, but

supplementary of the trihedral angle O—ABC.

APPENDIX.
PRISM, PYRAMID, CYLINDER, SPHERE, AND CONE
DEFINITIONS.
i. A polyhedron is a solid figure contained by plane figures: if it be contained
by four plane figures it is called a tetrahedron; by six, a hexahedron; by eight,
an octahedron; by twelve, a dodecahedron; and if by twenty, an icosahedron.
ii. If the plane faces of a polyhedron be equal and similar rectilineal figures,
it is called a regular polyhedron.
iii. A pyramid is a polyhedron of which all the faces but one meet in a point.
This point is called the vertex ; and the opposite face, the base.
iv. A prism is a polyhedron having a pair of parallel faces which are equal
and similar rectilineal figures, and are called its ends. The others, called its side
faces, are parallelograms.
v. A prism whose ends are perpendicular to its sides is called a right prism;
any other is called an oblique prism.
vi. The altitude of a pyramid is the length of the perpendicular drawn from
its vertex to its base; and the altitude of a prism is the perpendicular distance
between its ends.
vii. A parallelopiped is a prism whose bases are parallelograms. A parallelopiped is evidently a hexahedron.
viii. A cube is a rectangular parallelopiped, all whose sides are squares.
ix. A cylinder is a solid figure formed by the revolution of a rectangle about
one of its sides, which remains fixed, and which is called its axis. The circles
which terminate a cylinder are called its bases or ends.
x. A cone is the solid figure described by the revolution of a right-angled
triangle about one of the legs, which remains fixed, and which is called the axis.
The other leg describes the base, which is a circle.
xi. A sphere is the solid described by the revolution of a semicircle about
a diameter, which remains fixed. The centre of the sphere is the centre of the
generating semicircle. Any line passing through the centre of a sphere and
terminated both ways by the surface is called a diameter.
PROP. I.—Theorem.
Right prisms (ABCDE–F GHIJ, A0B0C
0D0E0–F
0G0H0
I
0J
0
) which have bases (ABCDE, A0B0C
0D0E0
) that are equal and similar, and which have equal
altitudes, are equal.
183
Dem.—Apply the bases to each
other; then, since they are equal and
similar figures, they will coincide—
that is, the point A with A0
, B with
B0
, &c. And since AF is equal to
A0F
0
, and each is normal to its respective base, the: point F will coincide with F
0
. In the same manner
the points G, H, I, J will coincide
respectively with the points G0
, H0
,
I
0
, J
0
. Hence the prisms are equal in
every respect.
Cor. 1.—Right prisms which have equal bases (EF, E0F
0
) and equal altitudes
are equal in volume.
Dem.—Since the bases are equal, but not similar, we can suppose one of
them, EF, divided into parts A, B, C, and re-arranged so as to make them
coincide with the other [I. xxxv., note]; and since the prism on E0F
0
can be
subdivided in the same manner by planes perpendicular to the base, the proposition is evident.
Cor. 2.—The volumes of right prisms (X, Y ) having equal bases are proportional to their altitudes.
For, if the altitudes be in the ratio of m : n, X can be divided into m
prisms of equal altitudes by planes parallel to the base; then these m prisms
will be all equal. In like manner, Y can be divided into n equal prisms. Hence
X : Y :: m : n.
Cor. 3.—In right prisms of equal altitudes the volumes are to one another
as the areas of their bases. This may be proved by dividing the bases into parts
so that the subdivisions will be equal, and then the volumes proportional to the
number of subdivisions in their respective bases, that is, to their areas.
Cor. 4.—The volume of a rectangular parallelopiped is measured by the
continued product of its three dimensions.
PROP. II.—Theorem.
Parallelopipeds (ABCD–EF GH, ABCD–MNOP), having a common base
(ABCD) and equal altitudes, are equal.
184
1
?
. Let the edges MN, EF be in one right line; then GH, OP must be in
one right line. Now EF = MN, because each equal AB; therefore ME = NF;
therefore the prisms AEM–DHP, and BF N–CGO, have their triangular bases
AEM, BF N identically equal, and they have equal altitudes; hence they are
equal; and supposing them taken away from the entire solid, the remaining
parallelopipeds ABCD–EF GH, ABCD–MNOP are equal.
2
?
. Let the edges EF, MN be in different lines; then produce ON, PM
to meet the lines EF and GH produced in the points J, K, L, I. Then by
1
?
the parallelopipeds ABCD–EF GH, ABCD–MNOP are each equal to the
parallelopiped ABCD–IJKL. Hence they an equal to one another.
Cor.—The volume of any parallelopiped is equal to the product of its base
and altitude.
PROP. III.—Theorem.
A diagonal plane of a parallelopiped divides it into two prisms of equal volume.
185
1
?
. When the parallelopiped is rectangular the proposition is evident.
2
?
. When it is any parallelopiped, ABCD–EF GH, the diagonal plane bisects it.
Dem.—Through the vertices A, E let planes
be drawn perpendicular to the edges and cutting
them in the points I, J, K; L, M, N, respectively. Then [I. xxxiv.] we have IL = BF, because each is equal to AE. Hence IB = LF.
In like manner JC = MG. Hence the pyramid
A–IJCB agrees in everything but position with
E–LMGF; hence it is equal to it in volume. To
each add the solid ABC–LME, and we have the
prism AIJ–ELM equal to the prism ABC–EF G.
In like manner AJK–EMN = ACD–EGH; but
(1?
) the prism AIJ–ELM = AJK–EMN. Hence
ABC–EF G = ACD–EGH. Therefore the diagonal plane bisects the parallelopiped.
Cor. 1.—The volume of a triangular prism is
equal to the product of its base and altitude; because it is half of a parallelopiped, which has a
double base and equal altitude.
Cor. 2.—The volume of any prism is equal to the product of its base and
altitude; because it can be divided into triangular prisms.
PROP. IV.—Theorem.
If a pyramid (O–ABCDE) be cut by any plane (abcde) parallel to the base, the
section is similar to the base.
Dem.—Because the plane AOB cuts the parallel planes ABCDE, abcde, the sections AB,
ab are parallel [XI. xvi.] In like manner BC,
bc are parallel. Hence the angle ABC = abc
[XI. x.]. In like manner the remaining angles of
the polygon ABCDE are equal to the corresponding angles of abcde. Again, because ab is parallel to AB, the triangles ABO, abO are equiangular.
Hence AB : BO :: ab : bO. [VI. iv.]
In like manner BO : BC :: bO : bc;
therefore AB : BC :: ab : bc. [Ex æquali.]
In like manner BC : CD :: bc : cd, &c.
Therefore the polygons ABCDE, abcde are
equiangular, and have the sides about their equal angles proportional. Hence
they are similar.
186
Cor. 1.—The edges and the altitude of the pyramid are similarly divided by
the parallel plane.
Cor. 2.—The areas of parallel sections are in the duplicate ratio of the distances of their planes from the vertex.
Cor. 3.—In any two pyramids, sections parallel to their bases, which divide
their altitudes in the same ratio, are proportional to their bases.
PROP. V.—Theorem.
Pyramids (P–ABCD, p–abc), having equal altitudes (P O, po) and bases
(ABCD, abc) of equal areas, have equal volumes.
Dem.—If they be not equal in volume, let abc be the base of the greater;
and let ox be the altitude of a prism, with an equal base, and whose volume
is equal to their difference; then let the equal altitudes P O, po be divided into
such a number of equal parts, by planes parallel to the bases of the pyramids,
that each part shall be less than ox. Then [iv. Cor. 3] the sections made by
these planes will be equal each to each. Now let prisms be constructed on these
sections as bases and with the equal parts of the altitudes of the pyramids as
altitudes, and let the prisms in P–ABCD be constructed below the sections,
and in p–abc, above. Then it is evident that the sum of the prisms in P–ABCD
is less than that pyramid, and the sum of those on the sections of p–abc greater
than p–abc. Therefore the difference between the pyramids is less than the
difference between the sums of the prisms, that is, less than the lower prism in
the pyramid p–abc; but the altitude of this prism is less than ox (const.). Hence
187
the difference between the pyramids is less than the prism whose base is equal
to one of the equal bases, and whose altitude is equal to ox, and the difference
is equal to this prism (hyp.), which is impossible. Therefore the volumes of the
pyramids are equal.
Cor. 1.—The volume of a triangular pyramid E–
ABC is one third the volume of the prism ABC–
DEF, having the same base and altitude.
For, draw the plane EAF, then the pyramids E–
AF C, E–AF D are equal, having equal bases AF C,
AF D, and a common altitude; and the pyramids
E–ABC, F–ABC are equal, having a common base
and equal altitudes. Hence the pyramid E–ABC is
one of three equal pyramids into which the prism is
divided. Therefore it is one third of the prism.
Cor. 2.—The volume of every pyramid is onethird of the volume of a prism having an equal base
and altitude.
Because it may be divided into triangular pyramids by planes through the
vertex and the diagonals of the base.
PROP. VI.—Theorem.
The volume of a cylinder is equal to the product of the area of its base by its
altitude
.
Dem.—Let O be the centre of its circular base; and take the angle AOB indefinitely
small, so that the arc AB may be regarded as
a right line. Then planes perpendicular to the
base, and cutting it in the lines OA, OB, will
be faces of a triangular prism, whose base will
be the triangle AOB, and whose altitude will
be the altitude of the cylinder. The volume
of this prism will be equal to the area of the
triangle AOB by the height of the cylinder.
Hence, dividing the circle into elementary triangles, the cylinder will be equal to the sum of all the prisms, and therefore its
volume will be equal to the area of the base multiplied by the altitude.
Cor. 1.—If r be the radius, and h the height of the cylinder,
vol. of cylinder = ?r2h.
Cor. 2.—If ABCD be a rectangle; X a line
in its plane parallel to the side AB; O the
middle point of the rectangle; the volume of
188
the solid described by the revolution of ABCD
round X is equal to the area of ABCD multiplied by the circumference of the circle described by O.
Dem.—Produce the lines AD, BC to meet
X in the points E, F. Then when the rectangle revolves round X, the rectangles
ABF E, DCF E will describe cylinders whose bases will be circles having AE,
DE as radii, and whose common altitude will be AB. Hence the difference between the volumes of these cylinders will be equal to the differences between the
areas of the bases multiplied by AB, that is = ?(AE2 ? DE2
). AB. Therefore
the volume described by ABCD
= ? . AB .(AE + DE)(AE ? DE);
but AE + DE = 2OG, and AE ? DE = AD.
Hence volume described by the rectangle ABCD
= 2? . OG . AB . AD.
= rectangle ABCD multiplied by the circumference of
the circle described by its middle point O.
Observation.—This Cor. is a simple case of Guldinus’s celebrated theorem. By its assistance we give in the two following corollaries original methods of finding the volumes of the
cone and sphere, and it may be applied with equal facility to the solution of several other
problems which are usually done by the Integral Calculus.
Cor. 3.—The volume of a cone is one-third the volume of a cylinder having
the same base and altitude.
Dem.—Let ABCD be a rectangle
whose diagonal is AC. The triangle
ABC will describe a cone, and the rectangle a cylinder by revolving round AB.
Take two points E, F infinitely near each
other in AC, and form two rectangles,
EH, EK, by drawing lines parallel to
AD, AB. Now if O, O0 be the middle
points of these rectangles, it is evident
that, when the whole figure revolves round AB, the circumference of the circle
described by O0 will ultimately be twice the circumference of the circle described
by O; and since the parallelogram EK is equal to EH [I. xliii.], the solid described by EK (Cor. 1) will be equal to twice the solid described by EH. Hence,
if AC be divided into an indefinite number of equal parts, and rectangles corresponding to EH, EK be inscribed in the triangles ABC, ADC, the sum of
the solids described by the rectangles in the triangle ADC is equal to twice the
sum of the solids described by the rectangles in the triangle ABC—that is, the
difference between the cylinder and cone is equal to twice the cone. Hence the
cylinder is equal to three times the cone.
Or thus: We may regard the cone and the cylinder as limiting cases of a pyramid and
prism having the same base and altitude; and since (v. Cor. 2) the volume of a pyramid is
one-third of the volume of a prism, having the same base and altitude, the volume of the cone
is one-third of the volume of the cylinder.
189
Cor. 4.—If r be the radius of the base of a cone, and h its height,
vol. of cone = ?r2h
3
.
Cor. 5.—The volume of a sphere is two-thirds of the volume of a circumscribed cylinder.
Dem.—Let AB be the diameter of the semicircle which describes the sphere;
ABCD the rectangle which describes the cylinder. Take two points E, F indefinitely near each other in the semicircle. Join EF, which will be a tangent, and
produce it to meet the diameter P Q perpendicular to AB in N. Let R be the
centre. Join RE; draw EG, F H, NL parallel to AB; and EI, FK parallel to
P Q; and produce to meet LN in M and L; and let O, O0 be the middle points
of the rectangles EH, EK.
Now the rectangle NG . GR = P G . GQ, because each is equal to GE2
.
Hence NG : GP :: GQ : GR, or ME : IE :: RP + RG : RG. Now, denoting
the radii of the circles described by the points O, O0 by ?, ?
0
respectively, we
have ultimately ? = GR and ?
0 =
1
2
(RP + RG). Hence ME : IE :: 2?
0
: ?; but
ME : IE :: rectangle EL : rectangle EK :: [I. xliii.] EH : EK;
? EH : EK :: 2?
0
: ?;
? 2?? . EH = 2(2??0
. EK).
Hence the solid described by EH equal twice the solid described by EK. Therefore we infer, as in the last Cor., that the whole volume of the sphere is equal
190
to twice the difference between the cylinder and sphere. Therefore the sphere is
two-thirds of the cylinder.
Cor. 6.—If r be the radius of a sphere,
vol. = 4?r3
3
.
PROP. VII.—Theorem.
The surface of a sphere is equal to the convex surface of the circumscribed
cylinder.
Dem.—Let AB be the diameter of the semicircle which describes the sphere.
Take two points, E, F, indefinitely near each other in the semicircle. Join EF,
and produce to meet the tangent CD parallel to AB in N. Draw EI, FK
parallel to P Q. Produce EI to meet AB in G. Let O be the centre. Join OE.
Now we have F E : KI :: EN : IN [VI. ii.];
but EN : IN :: OE : EG,
because the triangles ENI and OEG are similar.
Hence F E : KI :: OE : EG;
but OE = IG.
Hence EF : IK :: IG : EG; and IG : EG :: circumference of circle described
by the point I : circumference of circle described by the point E. Hence the
rectangle contained by EF, and circumference of circle described by E is equal
to the rectangle contained by IK, and circumference of circle described by I—
that is, the portion of the spherical surface described by EF is equal to the
191
portion of the cylindrical surface described by IK. Hence it is evident, if planes
be drawn perpendicular to the diameter AB—that the portions of cylindrical
and spherical surface between any two of them are equal. Hence the whole
spherical surface is equal to the cylindrical surface described by CD.
Or thus: Conceive the whole surface of the sphere divided into an indefinitely great
number of equal parts, then it is evident that each of these may be regarded as the base of
a pyramid having the centre of the sphere as a common vertex. Therefore the volume of the
sphere is equal to the whole area of the surface multiplied by one-third of the radius. Hence
if S denote the surface, we have
S ×
r
3
=
4?r3
3
[vi., Cor. 6];
therefore S = 4?r2
.
That is, the area of the surface of a sphere is equal four times the area of one of its great
circles.

NOTES.
NOTE A.
MODERN THEORY OF PARALLEL LINES.
In every plane there is one special line called the line at infinity. The point where any
other line in the plane cuts the line at infinity is called the point at infinity in that line. All
other points in the line are called finite points. Two lines in the plane which meet the line
at infinity in the same point are said to have the same direction, and two lines which meet
it in different points to have different directions. Two lines which have the same direction
cannot meet in any finite point [I. Axiom x.], and are parallel. Two lines which have different
directions must intersect in some finite point, since, if produced, they meet the line at infinity
in different points. This is a fundamental conception in Geometry, it is self-evident, and may
be assumed as an Axiom (see Observations on the Axioms, Book I.). Hence we may infer the
following general proposition:—“Any two lines in the same plane must meet in some point in
that plane; that is—(1) at infinity, when the lines have the same direction; (2) in some finite
point, when they have different directions.”—See Poncelet, Propri´et´es Projectives, page 52.
NOTE B.
legendre’s and hamilton’s proofs of euclid, I. xxxii.
The discovery of the Proposition that “the sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to
two right angles” is attributed to Pythagoras. Until modern times no proof of it, independent
of the theory of parallels, was known. We shall give here two demonstrations, each independent
of that theory. These are due to two of the greatest mathematicians of modern times—one,
the founder of the Theory of Elliptic Functions; the other, the discoverer of the Calculus of
Quaternions.
Legendre’s Proof.—Let ABC be a triangle, of which the side AC is the greatest. Bisect
BC in D. Join AD. Then AD is less than AC [I. xix. Ex. 5]. Now, construct a new triangle
AB0C0
, having the side AC0 = 2AD, and AB0 = AC. Again, bisect B0C0
in D0
, and form
another triangle AB00C00, having AC00 = 2AD0
, and AB00 = AC0
, &c. (1) The sum of the
angles of the triangle ABC = the sum of the angles of AB0C0
[I. xvi. Cor. 1] = the sum of the
angles of AB00C00 = the sum of the angles of AB000C000, &c. (2) The angle B0AC0
is less than
half BAC; the angle B00AC00 is less than half B0AC0
, and so on; hence the angle B(n)A(n)
will ultimately become infinitely small. (3) The sum of the base angles of any triangle of the
series is equal to the angle of the preceding triangle (see Dem. I. xvi.). Hence, if the annexed
diagram represent the triangle AB(n+1)C(n+1), the sum of the base angles A and C(n+1) is
194
equal to the angle B(n)C(n)
; and when n is indefinitely large, this angle is an infinitesimal;
hence the point B(n+1) will ultimately be in the line AC, and the angle AB(n+1)C(n+1) will
become a straight angle [I. Def. x.], that is, it is equal to two right angles; but the sum of the
angles of AB(n+1)C(n+1) is equal to the sum of the angles ABC. Hence the sum of the three
angles of ABC is equal to two right angles.
Hamilton’s Quaternion Proof.—Let ABC be the triangle. Produce BA to D, and
make AD equal to AC. Produce CB to E, and make BE equal to BD; finally, produce AC
to F, and make CF equal to CE. Denote the exterior angles thus formed by A0
, B0
, C0
. Now
let the leg AC of the angle A0 be turned round the point A through the angle A0
; then the
point C will coincide with D. Again, let the leg BD of the angle B0 be turned round the point
B through the angle B0
, until BD coincides with BE; then the point D will coincide with E.
Lastly, let CE be turned round C, through the angle C0
, until CE coincides with CF, and
the point E with F. Now, it is evident that by these rotations the point C has been brought
successively into the positions D, E, F; hence, by a motion of mere translation along the line
F C, the line CA can be brought into its former position. Therefore it follows, since rotation
is independent of translation, that the amount of the three rotations is equal to one complete
revolution round the point A; therefore A0 + B0 + C0 = four right angles; but
A + A
0 + B + B
0 + C + C
0 = six right angles [I. xiii.];
hence A + B + C = two right angles.
Observation.—The foregoing demonstration is the most elementary that was ever given of
this celebrated Proposition. I have reduced it to its simplest form, and without making any
use of the language of Quaternions. The same method of proof will establish the more general
Proposition, that the sum of the external angles of any convex rectilineal figure is equal to
four right angles.
Mr. Abbott, f.t.c.d., has informed me that this demonstration was first given by Playfair
in 1826, so that Hamilton was anticipated. It has been objected to on the ground that,
applied verbatim to a spherical triangle, it would lead to the conclusion that the sum of the
angles is two right angles, which being wrong, proves that the method is not valid. A slight
consideration will show that the cases are different. In the proof given in the text there are
three motions of rotation, in each of which a point describes an arc of a circle, followed by
a motion of translation, in which the same point describes a right line, and returns to its
original position. On the surface of a sphere we should have, corresponding to these, three
195
motions of rotation, in each of which the point would describe an arc of a circle, followed by a
motion of rotation about the centre of the sphere, in which the point should describe an arc
of a great circle to return to its original position. Hence, the proof for a plane triangle cannot
be applied to a spherical triangle.

to inscribe a regular polygon of seventeen sides in a circle.
Analysis.—Let A be one of the angular points, AO the diameter, A1, A2, . . . A8 the vertices at one side of AO. Produce OA3 to M, and OA2 to P, making A3M = OA5, and
A2P = OA8. Again, cut off A6N = OA7, and A1Q = OA4. Lastly, cut off OR = ON, and
OS = OQ. Then we have [IV. Ex. 40],
?1?4 = R(?3 + ?5) = R . OM,
?2?8 = R(?6 ? ?7) = R . ON;
but ?1?2?4?8 =R
4
[IV. Ex. 34];
therefore OM . ON =R

(1).
In like manner, OP . OQ =R

Again, OM . ON = (?3 + ?5)(?6 ? ?7)
= ?3?6 + ?5?6 ? ?3?7 ? ?5?7
= R(?3 ? ?8) + R(?1 ? ?6) ? R(?2 ? ?7) ? R(?2 ? ?5) [IV. Ex. 40].
= R(OM ? ON ? OP + OQ) = R(MR ? P S) :
MR ? P S = R.
Again, MR . P S = (OM ? ON)(OP ? OQ)
= (?3 + ?5 ? ?6 + ?7)(?2 + ?8 ? ?1 + ?4);
196
and performing the multiplication and substituting, we get
4R(OM ? ON ? OP + OQ) = 4R
2
.
Hence, the rectangle and the difference of the lines MR and P S being given, each is given;
hence MR is given; but MR = OM ? ON; therefore OM ? ON is given; and we have proved
that the rectangle OM . ON = R2
; therefore OM and ON are each given. In like manner,
OP and OQ are each given.
Again,
?6 . ?7 = R(?1 ? ?4) = R . OQ, and ?6 ? ?7 = ON.
Hence, since OQ and ON are each given, ?6 and ?7 are each given; therefore we can draw these
chords, and we have the arc A6A7 between their extremities given; that is, the seventeenth
part of the circumference of a circle. Hence the problem is solved.
The foregoing analysis is due to Ampere: see Catalan, Th´eor`emes et Probl`emes de
G´eom´etrie El´ementaire. We have abridged and simplified Ampere’s solution.
NOTE D.
to find two mean proportionals between two given lines.
The problem to find two mean proportionals is one of the most celebrated in Geometry
on account of the importance which the ancients attached to it. It cannot be solved by the
line and circle, but is very easy by Conic Sections. The following is a mechanical construction
by the Ruler and Compass.
Sol.—Let the extremes AB, BC be placed at right angles to each other; complete the
rectangle ABCD, and describe a circle about it. Produce DA, DC, and let a graduated ruler
be made to revolve round the point B, and so adjusted that BE shall be equal to GF; then
AF, CE are two mean proportionals between AB, BC.
Dem.—Since BE is equal to GF, the rectangle BE . GE = BF . GF. Therefore DE . CE
= DF . AF; hence DE : DF :: AF : CE; and by similar triangles, AB : AF :: DE : DF, and
CE : CB :: DE : DF. Hence AB : AF :: AF : CE; and AF : CE :: CE : CB. Therefore
AB, AF, CE, CB are continual proportions. Hence [VI. Def. iv.] AF, CE are two mean
proportionals between AB and BC.
The foregoing elegant construction is due to the ancient Geometer Philo of Byzantium.
If we join DG it will be perpendicular to EF. The line EF is called Philo’s Line; it possesses
the remarkable property of being the minimum line through the point B between the fixed
lines DE, DF.
Newton’s Construction.—Let AB and L be the two given lines of which AB is the
greater. Bisect AB in C. With A as centre and AC as radius, describe a circle, and in it
place the chord CD equal to the second line L. Join BD, and draw by trial through A a line
meeting BD, CD produced in the points E, F, so that the intercept EF will be equal to the
radius of the circle. DE and F A are the mean proportionals required.
197
Dem.—Join AD. Since the line BF cuts the sides of the 4 ACE, we have
AB . CD . EF = CB . DE . F A; but EF = CB;
therefore AB . CD = DE . F A, or
CD
DE
=
F A
AB
.
Again, since the 4 ACD is isosceles, we have
ED . EC = EA2 ? AC2 = (F A + AC)
2 ? AC2
= 2F A . AC + F A2 = F A . AB + F A2
.
Hence ED(ED + CD) = F A(AB + F A),
or DE2

1 +
CD
DE 
= F A . AB 
1 +
AF
AB 
,
therefore DE2 = F A . AB, and we have AB . CD = DE . F A.
Hence AB, DE, F A, CD are in continued proportion.
NOTE E.
on philo’s line.
I am indebted to Professor Galbraith for the following proof of the minimum property of
Philo’s Line. It is due to the late Professor Mac Cullagh:—Let AC, CB be two given lines, E
a fixed point, CD a perpendicular on AB; it is required to prove, if AE is equal to DB, that
AB is a minimum.
Dem.—Through E draw EM parallel to BC; make EN = EM; produce AB until
EP = AB. Through the points N, P draw NT, RP each parallel to AC, and through P draw
P Q parallel to BC. It is easy to see from the figure that the parallelogram QR is equal to the
parallelogram MF, and is therefore given. Through P draw ST perpendicular to EP. Now,
since AE = DB, BP is equal to DB; therefore P S = CD. Again, since OP = AD, P T is
equal to CD; therefore P S = P T. Hence QR is the maximum parallelogram in the triangle
SV T.
198
Again, if any other line A0B be drawn through E, and produced to P
0
, so that EP0 = AP0
,
the point P
0 must fall outside ST, because the parallelogram Q0R0
, corresponding to QR, will
be equal to MF, and therefore equal to QR. Hence the line EP0
is greater than EP, or A0B0
is greater than AB. Hence AB is a minimum.
NOTE F.
on the trisection of an angle.
The following mechanical method of trisecting an angle occurred to me several years ago.
Apart from the interest belonging to the Problem, it is valuable to the student as a geometrical
exercise:—
To trisect a given angle ACB.
199
Sol.—Erect CD perpendicular to CA; bisect the angle BCD by CG, and make the angle
ECI equal half a right angle; it is evident that CI will fall between CB and CA. Then, if
we use a jointed ruler—that is two equal rulers connected by a pivot—and make CB equal to
the length of one of these rulers, and, with C as centre and CB as radius, describe the circle
BAM, cutting CI in I: at I draw the tangent IG, cutting CG in G.
Then, since ICG is half a right angle, and CIG is right, IGC is half a right angle; therefore
IC is equal to IG; but IC equal CB; therefore IG = CB—equal length of one of the two
equal rulers. Hence, if the rulers be opened out at right angles, and placed so that the pivot
will be at I, and one extremity at C, the other extremity at G; it is evident that the point B
will be between the two rulers; then, while the extremity at C remains fixed, let the other be
made to traverse the line GF, until the edge of the second ruler passes through B: it is plain
that the pivot moves along the circumference of the circle. Let CH, HF, be the positions of
the rulers when this happens; draw the line CH; the angle ACH is one-third of ACB.
Dem.—Produce BC to M. Join HM. Erect BO at right angles to BM. Then, because
CH = HF, the angle HCF = HF C, and the angle DCE = ECB (const.). Hence the angle
HCD = HBC [I. xxxii.], and the right angles ACD, CBO are equal; therefore the angle
ACH is equal to HBO; that is [III. xxxii.], equal to HMB, or to half the angle HCB. Hence
ACH is one-third of ACB.
NOTE G.
on the quadrature of the circle.
Modern mathematicians denote the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter by
the symbol ?. Hence, if r denote the radius, the circumference will be 2?r; and, since the area
of a circle [VI. xx. Ex. 15] is equal to half the rectangle contained by the circumference and the
radius, the area will be ?r2
. Hence, if the area be known, the value of ? will be known; and,
conversely, if the value of ? be known, the area is known. On this account the determination
of the value of ? is called “the problem of the quadrature of the circle,” and is one of the most
celebrated in Mathematics. It is now known that the value of ? is incommensurable; that is,
that it cannot be expressed as the ratio of any two whole numbers, and therefore that it can
be found only approximately; but the approximation can be carried as far as we please, just as
in extracting the square root we may proceed to as many decimal places as may be required.
The simplest approximate value of ? was found by Archimedes, namely, 22 : 7. This value is
tolerably exact, and is the one used in ordinary calculations, except where great accuracy is
required. The next to this in ascending order, viz. 355 : 113, found by Vieta, is correct to
six places of decimals. It differs very little from the ratio 3.1416 : 1, given in our elementary
books.
Several expeditious methods, depending on the higher mathematics, are known for calculating the value of ?. The following is an outline of a very simple elementary method for
determining this important constant. It depends on a theorem which is at once inferred from
VI., Ex. 87, namely “If a, A denote the reciprocals of the areas of any two polygons of the
same number of sides inscribed and circumscribed to a circle; a
0
, A0
the corresponding quantities for polygons of twice the number; a
0
is the geometric mean between a and A, and A0
the
arithmetic mean between a
0 and A.” Hence, if a and A be known, we can, by the processes of
finding arithmetic and geometric means, find a
0 and A0
. In like manner, from a
0
, A0 we can
find a
00
, A00 related to a
0
, A0
; as a
0
, A0 are to a, A. Therefore, proceeding in this manner until
we arrive at values a
(n)
, A(n)
that will agree in as many decimal places as there are in the
degree of accuracy we wish to attain; and since the area of a circle is intermediate between
the reciprocals of a
(n) and A(n)
, the area of the circle can be found to any required degree of
approximation.
200
If for simplicity we take the radius of the circle to be unity, and commence with the
inscribed and circumscribed squares, we have
a = .5, A = .25.
a
0 = .3535533, A0 = .3017766.
a
00 = .3264853, A00 = .3141315.
These numbers are found thus: a
0
is the geometric mean between a and A; that is, between
.5 and .25, and A0
is the arithmetic mean between a
0 and A, or between .3535533 and .25.
Again, a
00 is the geometric mean between a
0 and A0
; and A00 the arithmetic mean between
a
00 and A0
. Proceeding in this manner, we find a
(13) = .3183099; A(13) = .3183099. Hence
the area of a circle radius unity, correct to seven decimal places, is equal to the reciprocal of
.3183099; that is, equal to 3.1415926; or the value of ? correct to seven places of decimals
is 3.1415926. The number ? is of such fundamental importance in Geometry, that mathematicians have devoted great attention to its calculation. Mr. Shanks, an English computer,
carried the calculation to 707 places of decimals. The following are the first 36 figures of his
result:—
3.141, 592, 653, 589, 793, 238, 462, 643, 383, 279, 502, 884.
The result is here carried far beyond all the requirements of Mathematics. Ten decimals are
sufficient to give the circumference of the earth to the fraction of an inch, and thirty decimals
would give the circumference of the whole visible universe to a quantity imperceptible with
the most powerful microscope.
201
CONCLUSION.
In the foregoing Treatise we have given the Elementary Geometry of the
Point, the Line, and the Circle, and figures formed by combinations of these.
But it is important to the student to remark, that points and lines, instead of
being distinct from, are limiting cases of, circles; and points and planes limiting
cases of spheres. Thus, a circle whose radius diminishes to zero becomes a
point. If, on the contrary, the circle be continually enlarged, it may have its
curvature so much diminished, that any portion of its circumference may be
made to differ in as small a degree as we please from a right line, and become
one when the radius becomes infinite. This happens when the centre, but not
the circumference, goes to infinity.

FIRST SIX BOOKS OF THE ELEMENTS OF EUCLID.

EXTRACTS FROM CRITICAL NOTICES.
“Nature,” April 17, 1884.
“We have noticed (‘Nature,’ vol. xxiv., p. 52; vol. xxvi., p. 219) two previous editions
of this book, and are glad to find that our favourable opinion of it has been so convincingly
indorsed by teachers and students in general. The novelty of this edition is a Supplement
of Additional Propositions and Exercises. This contains an elegant mode of obtaining the
circle tangential to three given circles by the methods of false positions, constructions for a
quadrilateral, and a full account—for the first time in a text-book—of the Brocard, triplicate
ratio, and (what the author proposes to call) the cosine circles. Dr. Casey has collected
together very many properties of these circles, and, as usual with him, has added several
beautiful results of his own. He has done excellent service in introducing the circles to the
notice of English students.. . .We only need say we hope that this edition may meet with as
much acceptance as its predecessors, it deserves greater acceptance.”
The “Mathematical Magazine,” Erie, Pennsylvania.
“Dr. Casey, an eminent Professor of the Higher Mathematics and Mathematical Physics
in the Catholic University of Ireland, has just brought out a second edition of his unique
‘Sequel to the First Six Books of Euclid,’ in which he has contrived to arrange and to pack
more geometrical gems than have appeared in any single text-book since the days of the
self-taught Thomas Simpson. ‘The principles of Modern Geometry contained in the work
are, in the present state of Science, indispensable in Pure and Applied Mathematics, and in
Mathematical Physics; and it is important that the student should become early acquainted
with them.’
“Eleven of the sixteen sections into which the work is divided exhibit most excellent
specimens of geometrical reasoning and research. These will be found to furnish very neat
models for systematic methods of study. The other five sections contain 261 choice problems
for solution. Here the earnest student will find all that he needs to bring himself abreast
207
with the amazing developments that are being made almost daily in the vast regions of Pure
and Applied Geometry. On pp. 152 and 153 there is an elegant solution of the celebrated
Malfatti’s Problem.
“As our space is limited, we earnestly advise every lover of the ‘Bright Seraphic Truth’ and
every friend of the ‘Mathematical Magazine’ to procure this invaluable book without delay.”
The “Schoolmaster.”
“This book contains a large number of elementary geometrical propositions not given in
Euclid, which are required by every student of Mathematics. Here are such propositions as
that the three bisectors of the sides of a triangle are concurrent, needed in determining the
position of the centre of gravity of a triangle; propositions in the circle needed in Practical
Geometry and Mechanics; properties of the centres of similitudes, and the theories of inversion
and reciprocations so useful in certain electrical questions. The proofs are always neat, and
in many cases exceedingly elegant.”
The “Educational Times.”
“We have certainly seen nowhere so good an introduction to Modern Geometry, or so
copious a collection of those elementary propositions not given by Euclid, but which are
absolutely indispensable for every student who intends to proceed to the study of the Higher
Mathematics. The style and general get up of the book are, in every way, worthy of the
‘Dublin University Press Series,’ to which it belongs.”
The “School Guardian.”
“This book is a well-devised and useful work. It consists of propositions supplementary to
those of the first six books of Euclid, and a series of carefully arranged exercises which follow
each section. More than half the book is devoted to the Sixth Book of Euclid, the chapters
on the ‘Theory of Inversion’ and on the ‘Poles and Polars’ being especially good. Its method
skilfully combines the methods of old and modern Geometry; and a student well acquainted
with its subject-matter would be fairly equipped with the geometrical knowledge he would
require for the study of any branch of physical science.”
The “Practical Teacher.”
“Professor Casey’s aim has been to collect within reasonable compass all those propositions of Modern Geometry to which reference is often made, but which are as yet embodied
nowhere.. . .We can unreservedly give the highest praise to the matter of the book. In most
cases the proofs are extraordinarily neat.. . . The notes to the Sixth Book are the most satisfactory. Feuerbach’s Theorem (the nine-points circle touches inscribed and escribed circles)
is favoured with two or three proofs, all of which are elegant. Dr. Hart’s extension of it is
extremely well proved.. . .We shall have given sufficient commendation to the book when we
say, that the proofs of these (Malfatti’s Problem, and Miquel’s Theorem), and equally complex
problems, which we used to shudder to attack, even by the powerful weapons of analysis, are
easily and triumphantly accomplished by Pure Geometry.
208
“After showing what great results this book has accomplished in the minimum of space, it
is almost superfluous to say more. Our author is almost alone in the field, and for the present
need scarcely fear rivals.”
The “Academy.”
“Dr. Casey is an accomplished geometer, and this little book is worthy of his reputation.
It is well adapted for use in the higher forms of our schools. It is a good introduction to
the larger works of Chasles, Salmon, and Townsend. It contains both a text and numerous
examples.”
The “Journal of Education.”
“Dr. Casey’s ‘Sequel to Euclid’ will be found a most valuable work to any student who
has thoroughly mastered Euclid, and imbibed a real taste for geometrical reasoning.. . . The
higher methods of pure geometrical demonstration, which form by far the larger and more
important portion, are admirable; the propositions are for the most part extremely well given,
and will amply repay a careful perusal to advanced students.”
209
PREFACE.
Frequent applications having been made to Dr. Casey requesting him to
publish a ”Key” containing the Solutions of the Exercises in his ”Elements of
Euclid,” but his professorial and other duties scarcely leaving him any time to
devote to it, I undertook, under his direction, the task of preparing one. Every
Solution was examined and approved of by him before writing it for publication,
so that the work may be regarded as virtually his.
The Exercises are a joint selection made by him and the late lamented Professor Townsend, s.f.t.c.d., and form one of the finest collections ever published.

THE FIRST SIX BOOKS
OF THE
ELEMENTS OF EUCLID,
With Copious Annotations and Numerous Exercises.
BY
JOHN CASEY, LL.D., F.R.S.,
Fellow of the Royal University of Ireland; Vice-President, Royal Irish Academy; &c.
&c.
Dublin: Hodges, Figgis, & Co. London: Longmans, Green, & Co.
OPINIONS OF THE WORK.
The following are a few of the Opinions received by Dr. Casey on this
Work:—
“Teachers no longer need be at a loss when asked which of the numerous ‘Euclids’ they
recommend to learners. Dr. Casey’s will, we presume, supersede all others.”—The Dublin
Evening Mail.
“Dr. Casey’s work is one of the best and most complete treatises on Elementary Geometry we have seen. The annotations on the several propositions are specially valuable to
students.”—The Northern Whig.
“His long and successful experience as a teacher has eminently qualified Dr. Casey for the
task which he has undertaken.. . .We can unhesitatingly say that this is the best edition of
Euclid that has been yet offered to the public.”—The Freeman’s Journal.
From the Rev. R. Townsend, F.T.C.D., &c.
“I have no doubt whatever of the general adoption of your work through all the schools
of Ireland immediately, and of England also before very long.”
From George Francis FitzGerald, Esq., F.T.C.D.
”Your work on Euclid seems admirable, and is a great improvement in most ways on
its predecessors. It is a great thing to call the attention of students to the innumerable
variations in statement and simple deductions from propositions.. . . I should have preferred
some modification of Euclid to a reproduction, but I suppose people cannot be got to agree
to any.”
211
From H. J. Cooke, Esq., The Academy, Banbridge.
”In the clearness, neatness, and variety of demonstrations, it is far superior to any textbook yet published, whilst the exercises are all that could be desired.”
From James A. Poole, M.A., 29, Harcourt-street, Dublin.
”This work proves that Irish Scholars can produce Class-books which even the Head
Masters of English Schools will feel it a duty to introduce into their establishments.”
From Professor Leebody, Magee College, Londonderry.
”So far as I have had time to examine it, it seems to me a very valuable addition to
our text-books of Elementary Geometry, and a most suitable introduction to the ‘Sequel to
Euclid,’ which I have found an admirable book for class teaching.”
From Mrs. Bryant, F.C.P., Principal of the North London Collegiate School for Girls.
”I am heartily glad to welcome this work as a substitute for the much less elegant textbooks in vogue here. I have begun to use it already with some of my classes, and find that
the arrangement of exercises after each proposition works admirably.”
From the Rev. J. E. Reffe´, French College, Blackrock.
”I am sure you will soon be obliged to prepare a Second Edition. I have ordered fifty
copies more of the Euclid (this makes 250 copies for the French College). They all like the
book here.”
From the Nottingham Guardian.
”The edition of the First Six Books of Euclid by Dr. John Casey is a particularly useful
and able work.. . . The illustrative exercises and problems are exceedingly numerous, and have
been selected with great care. Dr. Casey has done an undoubted service to teachers in
preparing an edition of Euclid adapted to the development of the Geometry of the present
day.”
From the Leeds Mercury.
”There is a simplicity and neatness of style in the solution of the problems which will
be of great assistance to the students in mastering them.. . . At the end of each proposition
there is an examination paper upon it, with deductions and other propositions, by means
of which the student is at once enabled to test himself whether he has fully grasped the
principles involved.. . . Dr. Casey brings at once the student face to face with the difficulties
to be encountered, and trains him, stage by stage, to solve them.”
From the Practical Teacher.
”The preface states that this book ‘is intended to supply a want much felt by Teachers
at the present day–the production of a work which, while giving the unrivalled original in all
its integrity, would also contain the modern conceptions and developments of the portion of
Geometry over which the elements extend.’
”The book is all, and more than all, it professes to be.. . . The propositions suggested are
such as will be found to have most important applications, and the methods of proof are both
simple and elegant. We know no book which, within so moderate a compass, puts the student
in possession of such valuable results.
”The exercises left for solution are such as will repay patient study, and those whose
solution are given in the book itself will suggest the methods by which the others are to be
demonstrated. We recommend everyone who wants good exercises in Geometry to get the
book, and study it for themselves.”

From the Educational Times.
”The editor has been very happy in some of the changes he has made. The combination of
the general and particular enunciations of each proposition into one is good; and the shortening
of the proofs, by omitting the repetitions so common in Euclid, is another improvement. The
use of the contra-positive of a proved theorem is introduced with advantage, in place of
the reductio ad absurdum; while the alternative (or, in some cases, substituted) proofs are
numerous, many of them being not only elegant but eminently suggestive. The notes at the
end of the book are of great interest, and much of the matter is not easily accessible. The
collection of exercises, ‘of which there are nearly eight hundred,’ is another feature which will
commend the book to teachers. To sum up, we think that this work ought to be read by
every teacher of Geometry; and we make bold to say that no one can study it without gaining
valuable information, and still more valuable suggestions.”
From the Journal of Education, Sept. 1, 1883.
”In the text of the propositions, the author has adhered, in all but a few instances, to
the substance of Euclid’s demonstrations, without, however, giving way to a slavish following
of his occasional verbiage and redundance. The use of letters in brackets in the enunciations
eludes the necessity of giving a second or particular enunciation, and can do no harm. Hints
of other proofs are often given in small type at the end of a proposition, and, where necessary,
short explanations. The definitions are also carefully annotated. The theory of proportion,
Book V., is given in an algebraical form. This book has always appeared to us an exquisitely
subtle example of Greek mathematical logic, but the subject can be made infinitely simpler
and shorter by a little algebra, and naturally the more difficult method has yielded place to
the less. It is not studied in schools, it is not asked for even in the Cambridge Tripos; a few
years ago, it still survived in one of the College Examinations at St. John’s, but whether the
reforming spirit which is dominant there has left it, we do not know. The book contains a
very large body of riders and independent geometrical problems. The simpler of these are
given in immediate connexion with the propositions to which they naturally attach; the more
difficult are given in collections at the end of each book. Some of these are solved in the book,
and these include many well-known theorems, properties of orthocentre, of nine-point circle,
&c. In every way this edition of Euclid is deserving of commendation. We would also express
a hope that everyone who uses this book will afterwards read the same author’s ‘Sequel to
Euclid,’ where he will find an excellent account of more modern Geometry.”

1.F.
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ’AS-IS’ WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
http://www.gutenberg.org
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
