????? ? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ? ??. Let AB be the given finite straight-line.
??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??????? ???????? ?????????? So it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on
???????????. the straight-line AB.
?????? ??? ?? ? ?????????? ?? ?? ?? ?????? Let the circle BCD with center A and radius AB have
???????? ? ???, ??? ????? ?????? ??? ?? ? ?????????? ?? been drawn [Post. 3], and again let the circle ACE with
?? ?? ?????? ???????? ? ???, ??? ??? ??? ? ???????, center B and radius BA have been drawn [Post. 3]. And
???? ? ????????? ???????? ?? ??????, ??? ?? ?, ? ?????? let the straight-lines CA and CB have been joined from
???????????? ??????? ?? ??, ??. the point C, where the circles cut one another,†
to the
??? ???? ?? ? ??????? ??????? ???? ??? ??? ??????, points A and B (respectively) [Post. 1].
??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??? ?????, ???? ?? ? ??????? ??????? And since the point A is the center of the circle CDB,
???? ??? ??? ??????, ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??. ??????? ?? AC is equal to AB [Def. 1.15]. Again, since the point
??? ? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ??, ?? ?? ?? ????? B is the center of the circle CAE, BC is equal to BA
???. ?? ?? ?? ???? ??? ??? ???????? ????? ???? ??? ? ?? ??? [Def. 1.15]. But CA was also shown (to be) equal to AB.
?? ?? ????? ???? ?? ????? ??? ?? ??, ??, ?? ???? ???????? Thus, CA and CB are each equal to AB. But things equal
?????. to the same thing are also equal to one another [C.N. 1].
??????????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ????????. ??? ?????????? Thus, CA is also equal to CB. Thus, the three (straight??? ??? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ??? ??. ???? ???? lines) CA, AB, and BC are equal to one another.
???????. Thus, the triangle ABC is equilateral, and has been
constructed on the given finite straight-line AB. (Which
is) the very thing it was required to do.
† The assumption that the circles do indeed cut one another should be counted as an additional postulate. There is also an implicit assumption
that two straight-lines cannot share a common segment.
bþ. Proposition 2†
???? ?? ??????? ?????? ?? ??????? ?????? ???? ??????? To place a straight-line equal to a given straight-line
??????. at a given point (as an extremity).
????? ?? ??? ????? ??????? ?? ?, ? ?? ??????? ?????? Let A be the given point, and BC the given straight? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ? ?????? ?? ??????? ?????? ?? ?? line. So it is required to place a straight-line at point A
???? ??????? ??????. equal to the given straight-line BC.
?????????? ??? ??? ??? ? ??????? ??? ?? ? ??????? For let the straight-line AB have been joined from
?????? ? ??, ??? ????????? ??? ????? ???????? ?????????? point A to point B [Post. 1], and let the equilateral trian?? ???, ??? ????????????? ??? ??????? ???? ??, ?? gle DAB have been been constructed upon it [Prop. 1.1].

????? ??? ?? ? ??????? ??????? ???? ??? ???, ??? ????? Therefore, since the point B is the center of (the cir? ?? ?? ??. ?????, ???? ?? ? ??????? ??????? ???? ??? cle) CGH, BC is equal to BG [Def. 1.15]. Again, since
??? ??????, ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ?? ? ?? ?? ?? ??? the point D is the center of the circle GKL, DL is equal
?????. ????? ??? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ????? ???. ??????? ?? to DG [Def. 1.15]. And within these, DA is equal to DB.
??? ? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ??, ?? ?? ?? ????? Thus, the remainder AL is equal to the remainder BG
???. ?? ?? ?? ???? ??? ??? ???????? ????? ???? ??? ? ?? [C.N. 3]. But BC was also shown (to be) equal to BG.
??? ?? ?? ????? ???. Thus, AL and BC are each equal to BG. But things equal
???? ??? ?? ??????? ?????? ?? ? ?? ??????? ?????? to the same thing are also equal to one another [C.N. 1].
?? ?? ??? ?????? ?????? ? ??? ???? ???? ???????. Thus, AL is also equal to BC.
Thus, the straight-line AL, equal to the given straightline BC, has been placed at the given point A. (Which
is) the very thing it was required to do.
† This proposition admits of a number of different cases, depending on the relative positions of the point A and the line BC. In such situations,
Euclid invariably only considers one particular case—usually, the most difficult—and leaves the remaining cases as exercises for the reader.
gþ. Proposition 3
??? ???????? ??????? ?????? ??? ??? ???????? ?? For two given unequal straight-lines, to cut off from
???????? ???? ??????? ???????. the greater a straight-line equal to the lesser.
???????? ?? ???????? ??? ??????? ?????? ?? ??, ?, ?? Let AB and C be the two given unequal straight-lines,
?????? ???? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ?? ?? of which let the greater be AB. So it is required to cut off
???????? ?? ? ???? ??????? ???????. a straight-line equal to the lesser C from the greater AB.
?????? ???? ?? ? ?????? ?? ? ?????? ??? ? ??? ??? Let the line AD, equal to the straight-line C, have
?????? ??? ?? ? ?????????? ?? ?? ?? ?????? ???????? been placed at point A [Prop. 1.2]. And let the circle
? ???. DEF have been drawn with center A and radius AD
