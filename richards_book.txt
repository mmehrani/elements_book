Introduction
Euclid’s Elements is by far the most famous mathematical work of classical antiquity, and also has the distinction
of being the world’s oldest continuously used mathematical textbook. Little is known about the author, beyond
the fact that he lived in Alexandria around 300 BCE. The main subjects of the work are geometry, proportion, and
number theory.
Most of the theorems appearing in the Elements were not discovered by Euclid himself, but were the work of
earlier Greek mathematicians such as Pythagoras (and his school), Hippocrates of Chios, Theaetetus of Athens, and
Eudoxus of Cnidos. However, Euclid is generally credited with arranging these theorems in a logical manner, so as to
demonstrate (admittedly, not always with the rigour demanded by modern mathematics) that they necessarily follow
from five simple axioms. Euclid is also credited with devising a number of particularly ingenious proofs of previously
discovered theorems: e.g., Theorem 48 in Book 1.
The geometrical constructions employed in the Elements are restricted to those which can be achieved using a
straight-rule and a compass. Furthermore, empirical proofs by means of measurement are strictly forbidden: i.e.,
any comparison of two magnitudes is restricted to saying that the magnitudes are either equal, or that one is greater
than the other.
The Elements consists of thirteen books. Book 1 outlines the fundamental propositions of plane geometry, including the three cases in which triangles are congruent, various theorems involving parallel lines, the theorem regarding
the sum of the angles in a triangle, and the Pythagorean theorem. Book 2 is commonly said to deal with “geometric
algebra”, since most of the theorems contained within it have simple algebraic interpretations. Book 3 investigates
circles and their properties, and includes theorems on tangents and inscribed angles. Book 4 is concerned with regular polygons inscribed in, and circumscribed around, circles. Book 5 develops the arithmetic theory of proportion.
Book 6 applies the theory of proportion to plane geometry, and contains theorems on similar figures. Book 7 deals
with elementary number theory: e.g., prime numbers, greatest common denominators, etc. Book 8 is concerned with
geometric series. Book 9 contains various applications of results in the previous two books, and includes theorems
on the infinitude of prime numbers, as well as the sum of a geometric series. Book 10 attempts to classify incommensurable (i.e., irrational) magnitudes using the so-called “method of exhaustion”, an ancient precursor to integration.
Book 11 deals with the fundamental propositions of three-dimensional geometry. Book 12 calculates the relative
volumes of cones, pyramids, cylinders, and spheres using the method of exhaustion. Finally, Book 13 investigates the
five so-called Platonic solids.
This edition of Euclid’s Elements presents the definitive Greek text—i.e., that edited by J.L. Heiberg (1883–
1885)—accompanied by a modern English translation, as well as a Greek-English lexicon. Neither the spurious
books 14 and 15, nor the extensive scholia which have been added to the Elements over the centuries, are included.
The aim of the translation is to make the mathematical argument as clear and unambiguous as possible, whilst still
adhering closely to the meaning of the original Greek. Text within square parenthesis (in both Greek and English)
indicates material identified by Heiberg as being later interpolations to the original text (some particularly obvious or
unhelpful interpolations have been omitted altogether). Text within round parenthesis (in English) indicates material
which is implied, but not actually present, in the Greek text.

VOroi. Definitions
??. ??????? ?????, ?? ????? ?????. 1. A point is that of which there is no part.
??. ?????? ?? ????? ???????. 2. And a line is a length without breadth.
??. ??????? ?? ?????? ??????. 3. And the extremities of a line are points.
??. ?????? ?????? ?????, ???? ?? ???? ???? ??? ?????? 4. A straight-line is (any) one which lies evenly with
???????? ??????. points on itself.
??. ?????????? ?? ?????, ? ????? ??? ?????? ????? ????. 5. And a surface is that which has length and breadth
??. ??????????? ?? ?????? ???????. only.
??. ????????? ????????? ?????, ???? ?? ???? ???? ??? 6. And the extremities of a surface are lines.
?????? ???????? ??????. 7. A plane surface is (any) one which lies evenly with
??. ????????? ?? ????? ????? ? ?? ??????? ??? ??????? the straight-lines on itself.
????????? ??????? ??? ?? ??? ??????? ???????? ???? 8. And a plane angle is the inclination of the lines to
??????? ??? ??????? ??????. one another, when two lines in a plane meet one another,
??. ????? ?? ?? ??????????? ??? ?????? ??????? ??????? and are not lying in a straight-line.
????, ??????????? ???????? ? ?????. 9. And when the lines containing the angle are
??. ????? ?? ?????? ??? ??????? ???????? ??? ?????? straight then the angle is called rectilinear.
?????? ???? ???????? ????, ???? ??????? ??? ???? ?????? 10. And when a straight-line stood upon (another)
????, ??? ? ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????????, ??? ?? straight-line makes adjacent angles (which are) equal to
?????????. one another, each of the equal angles is a right-angle, and
???. ???????? ????? ????? ? ?????? ?????. the former straight-line is called a perpendicular to that
???. ?????? ?? ? ??????? ?????. upon which it stands.
???. ????? ?????, ? ????? ???? ?????. 11. An obtuse angle is one greater than a right-angle.
???. ????? ???? ?? ??? ????? ? ????? ???? ????????????. 12. And an acute angle (is) one less than a right-angle.
???. ?????? ???? ????? ???????? ??? ???? ??????? 13. A boundary is that which is the extremity of some???????????? [? ???????? ??????????], ???? ?? ??? ???? thing.
??????? ??? ????? ??? ???????? ???????? ????? ?? 14. A figure is that which is contained by some bound????????????? ??????? [???? ??? ??? ?????? ???????????] ary or boundaries.
???? ???????? ?????. 15. A circle is a plane figure contained by a single line
???. ??????? ?? ??? ?????? ?? ??????? ????????. [which is called a circumference], (such that) all of the
???. ????????? ?? ??? ?????? ????? ?????? ??? ??? ??? straight-lines radiating towards [the circumference] from
??????? ?????? ??? ??????????? ??? ??????? ?? ???? one point amongst those lying inside the figure are equal
??? ??? ??? ?????? ???????????, ???? ??? ???? ?????? ??? to one another.
??????. 16. And the point is called the center of the circle.
???. ??????????? ?? ???? ?? ???????????? ????? ??? ?? 17. And a diameter of the circle is any straight-line,
??? ????????? ??? ??? ??????????????? ??? ????? ????- being drawn through the center, and terminated in each
???????. ??????? ?? ??? ?????????? ?? ????, ? ??? ??? direction by the circumference of the circle. (And) any
?????? ?????. such (straight-line) also cuts the circle in half.†
???. ??????? ?????????? ???? ?? ??? ??????? ??- 18. And a semi-circle is the figure contained by the
?????????, ????????? ??? ?? ??? ?????, ??????????? ?? ?? diameter and the circumference cuts off by it. And the
??? ????????, ?????????? ?? ?? ??? ???????? ? ???????? center of the semi-circle is the same (point) as (the center
??????? ???????????. of) the circle.
??. ??? ?? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ??? 19. Rectilinear figures are those (figures) contained
???????? ???? ?? ??? ????? ???? ???? ???????, ????????? by straight-lines: trilateral figures being those contained
?? ?? ??? ??? ????? ???? ???? ???????, ???????? ?? ?? by three straight-lines, quadrilateral by four, and multi??? ????? ??????? ???? ???????. lateral by more than four.
??? ???? ?? ??? ?????????? ???????? ?????????? ??? 20. And of the trilateral figures: an equilateral trian???????? ???? ?? ???? ????? ??????, ??????????? ?? ?? gle is that having three equal sides, an isosceles (triangle)
???? ???????? ??????, ????????? ?? ?? ??? ????? ?????? that having only two equal sides, and a scalene (triangle)
???? ??????. that having three unequal sides.

STOIQEIWN aþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 1
???. ??? ?? ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ??? 21. And further of the trilateral figures: a right-angled
?????, ? ?????????? ?? ???? ??? ??????????, ?????????? triangle is that having a right-angle, an obtuse-angled
??, ? ?????????? ???, ??? ?????????? ??, ?????? ??, ? (triangle) that having an obtuse angle, and an acute?????????? ???, ??? ?????????? ??, ?????????? ?? ?? ??? angled (triangle) that having three acute angles.
?????????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????? ???? ???????? ????, ? 22. And of the quadrilateral figures: a square is that
???? ?????????? ????? ???? ??????????? ?? ?? ???? ????? which is right-angled and equilateral, a rectangle that
??????????? ???????? ????????. which is right-angled but not equilateral, a rhombus that
???. ?????????? ????? ???????, ??????? ?? ?? ???? which is equilateral but not right-angled, and a rhomboid
??????? ????? ??? ???????????? ??? ??????? ??? ??????? that having opposite sides and angles equal to one an?? ???? ??? ???????? ???????????? ????????. other which is neither right-angled nor equilateral. And
let quadrilateral figures besides these be called trapezia.
23. Parallel lines are straight-lines which, being in the
same plane, and being produced to infinity in each direction, meet with one another in neither (of these directions).
† This should really be counted as a postulate, rather than as part of a definition.
AÊt mata. Postulates
??. ???????? ??? ?????? ??????? ??? ??? ??????? 1. Let it have been postulated†
to draw a straight-line
??????? ??????? ???????. from any point to any point.
??. ??? ???????????? ??????? ???? ?? ??????? ??? 2. And to produce a finite straight-line continuously
??????? ????????. in a straight-line.
??. ??? ????? ?????? ??? ?????????? ?????? ?????????. 3. And to draw a circle with any center and radius.
??. ??? ????? ??? ????? ?????? ???? ???????? ?????. 4. And that all right-angles are equal to one another.
??. ??? ??? ??? ??? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ??? ????? 5. And that if a straight-line falling across two (other)
??? ??? ?? ???? ???? ?????? ??? ????? ????????? ????, straight-lines makes internal angles on the same side
???????????? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ??????? ??????????, ??? (of itself whose sum is) less than two right-angles, then
? ???? ????? ?? ??? ??? ????? ?????????. the two (other) straight-lines, being produced to infinity,
meet on that side (of the original straight-line) that the
(sum of the internal angles) is less than two right-angles
(and do not meet on the other side).‡
† The Greek present perfect tense indicates a past action with present significance. Hence, the 3rd-person present perfect imperative >Hit sjw
could be translated as “let it be postulated”, in the sense “let it stand as postulated”, but not “let the postulate be now brought forward”. The
literal translation “let it have been postulated” sounds awkward in English, but more accurately captures the meaning of the Greek.
‡ This postulate effectively specifies that we are dealing with the geometry of flat, rather than curved, space.
KoinaÈ ênnoiai. Common Notions

an inequality of the same type.

????? ? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ? ??. Let AB be the given finite straight-line.
??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??????? ???????? ?????????? So it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on
???????????. the straight-line AB.
?????? ??? ?? ? ?????????? ?? ?? ?? ?????? Let the circle BCD with center A and radius AB have
???????? ? ???, ??? ????? ?????? ??? ?? ? ?????????? ?? been drawn [Post. 3], and again let the circle ACE with
?? ?? ?????? ???????? ? ???, ??? ??? ??? ? ???????, center B and radius BA have been drawn [Post. 3]. And
???? ? ????????? ???????? ?? ??????, ??? ?? ?, ? ?????? let the straight-lines CA and CB have been joined from
???????????? ??????? ?? ??, ??. the point C, where the circles cut one another,†
to the
??? ???? ?? ? ??????? ??????? ???? ??? ??? ??????, points A and B (respectively) [Post. 1].
??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??? ?????, ???? ?? ? ??????? ??????? And since the point A is the center of the circle CDB,
???? ??? ??? ??????, ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??. ??????? ?? AC is equal to AB [Def. 1.15]. Again, since the point
??? ? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ??, ?? ?? ?? ????? B is the center of the circle CAE, BC is equal to BA
???. ?? ?? ?? ???? ??? ??? ???????? ????? ???? ??? ? ?? ??? [Def. 1.15]. But CA was also shown (to be) equal to AB.
?? ?? ????? ???? ?? ????? ??? ?? ??, ??, ?? ???? ???????? Thus, CA and CB are each equal to AB. But things equal
?????. to the same thing are also equal to one another [C.N. 1].
??????????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ????????. ??? ?????????? Thus, CA is also equal to CB. Thus, the three (straight??? ??? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ??? ??. ???? ???? lines) CA, AB, and BC are equal to one another.
???????. Thus, the triangle ABC is equilateral, and has been
constructed on the given finite straight-line AB. (Which
is) the very thing it was required to do.
† The assumption that the circles do indeed cut one another should be counted as an additional postulate. There is also an implicit assumption
that two straight-lines cannot share a common segment.
bþ. Proposition 2†
???? ?? ??????? ?????? ?? ??????? ?????? ???? ??????? To place a straight-line equal to a given straight-line
??????. at a given point (as an extremity).
????? ?? ??? ????? ??????? ?? ?, ? ?? ??????? ?????? Let A be the given point, and BC the given straight? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ? ?????? ?? ??????? ?????? ?? ?? line. So it is required to place a straight-line at point A
???? ??????? ??????. equal to the given straight-line BC.
?????????? ??? ??? ??? ? ??????? ??? ?? ? ??????? For let the straight-line AB have been joined from
?????? ? ??, ??? ????????? ??? ????? ???????? ?????????? point A to point B [Post. 1], and let the equilateral trian?? ???, ??? ????????????? ??? ??????? ???? ??, ?? gle DAB have been been constructed upon it [Prop. 1.1].

?????????? ?? ?? ?????? ???????? ? ???. [Post. 2]. And let the circle CGH with center B and radius BC have been drawn [Post. 3], and again let the circle GKL with center D and radius DG have been drawn
[Post. 3].

????? ??? ?? ? ??????? ??????? ???? ??? ???, ??? ????? Therefore, since the point B is the center of (the cir? ?? ?? ??. ?????, ???? ?? ? ??????? ??????? ???? ??? cle) CGH, BC is equal to BG [Def. 1.15]. Again, since
??? ??????, ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ?? ? ?? ?? ?? ??? the point D is the center of the circle GKL, DL is equal
?????. ????? ??? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ????? ???. ??????? ?? to DG [Def. 1.15]. And within these, DA is equal to DB.
??? ? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ??, ?? ?? ?? ????? Thus, the remainder AL is equal to the remainder BG
???. ?? ?? ?? ???? ??? ??? ???????? ????? ???? ??? ? ?? [C.N. 3]. But BC was also shown (to be) equal to BG.
??? ?? ?? ????? ???. Thus, AL and BC are each equal to BG. But things equal
???? ??? ?? ??????? ?????? ?? ? ?? ??????? ?????? to the same thing are also equal to one another [C.N. 1].
?? ?? ??? ?????? ?????? ? ??? ???? ???? ???????. Thus, AL is also equal to BC.
Thus, the straight-line AL, equal to the given straightline BC, has been placed at the given point A. (Which
is) the very thing it was required to do.
† This proposition admits of a number of different cases, depending on the relative positions of the point A and the line BC. In such situations,
Euclid invariably only considers one particular case—usually, the most difficult—and leaves the remaining cases as exercises for the reader.
gþ. Proposition 3
??? ???????? ??????? ?????? ??? ??? ???????? ?? For two given unequal straight-lines, to cut off from
???????? ???? ??????? ???????. the greater a straight-line equal to the lesser.
???????? ?? ???????? ??? ??????? ?????? ?? ??, ?, ?? Let AB and C be the two given unequal straight-lines,
?????? ???? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ?? ?? of which let the greater be AB. So it is required to cut off
???????? ?? ? ???? ??????? ???????. a straight-line equal to the lesser C from the greater AB.
?????? ???? ?? ? ?????? ?? ? ?????? ??? ? ??? ??? Let the line AD, equal to the straight-line C, have
?????? ??? ?? ? ?????????? ?? ?? ?? ?????? ???????? been placed at point A [Prop. 1.2]. And let the circle
? ???. DEF have been drawn with center A and radius AD
??? ???? ?? ? ??????? ??????? ???? ??? ??? ??????, [Post. 3].

STOIQEIWN aþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 1
??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??? ? ? ?? ?? ????? ???. And since point A is the center of circle DEF, AE
??????? ??? ??? ??, ? ?? ?? ????? ???? ???? ??? ? ?? is equal to AD [Def. 1.15]. But, C is also equal to AD.
?? ? ????? ???. Thus, AE and C are each equal to AD. So AE is also
equal to C [C.N. 1].

???? ???????. off from the greater AB. (Which is) the very thing it was
required to do.
dþ. Proposition 4
???? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??????? [????] ???? ???????? If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, re???? ??? ???????? ??????? ??? ??? ?????? ?? ????? ???? spectively, and have the angle(s) enclosed by the equal
??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ??????? ????????????, ??? ??? straight-lines equal, then they will also have the base
????? ?? ????? ???? ????, ??? ?? ???????? ?? ??????? ???? equal to the base, and the triangle will be equal to the tri?????, ??? ?? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????? ??????? ???? ??????? angle, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal
??????? ???????, ??? ?? ?? ???? ??????? ????????????. sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles.

????? ??? ??????? ?? ???, ??? ??? ??? ??????? Let ABC and DEF be two triangles having the two
??? ??, ?? ???? ???? ???????? ???? ??, ?? ???? ?????? sides AB and AC equal to the two sides DE and DF, re???????? ??????? ??? ??? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?? ?? ?? ?? spectively. (That is) AB to DE, and AC to DF. And (let)
??? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ????. ????, the angle BAC (be) equal to the angle EDF. I say that
??? ??? ????? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ??? ?????, ??? ?? ??? the base BC is also equal to the base EF, and triangle
???????? ?? ??? ??????? ???? ?????, ??? ?? ?????? ?????? ABC will be equal to triangle DEF, and the remaining
???? ??????? ??????? ???? ??????? ??????? ???????, ??? ?? angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the
?? ???? ??????? ????????????, ? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???, corresponding remaining angles. (That is) ABC to DEF,
? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???. and ACB to DFE.
?????????????? ??? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ?? ??? For if triangle ABC is applied to triangle DEF,
†
the
???????? ??? ????????? ??? ??? ? ??????? ??? ?? ? ??????? point A being placed on the point D, and the straight-line
10
STOIQEIWN aþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 1
??? ?? ?? ??????? ??? ??? ??, ????????? ??? ?? ? ??????? AB on DE, then the point B will also coincide with E,
??? ?? ? ??? ?? ???? ????? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??????????? ?? on account of AB being equal to DE. So (because of)
??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ????????? ??? ? ?? ?????? ??? ??? ?? AB coinciding with DE, the straight-line AC will also
??? ?? ???? ????? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ?? ??? ???? ???? ??? coincide with DF, on account of the angle BAC being
?? ? ??????? ??? ?? ? ??????? ????????? ??? ?? ???? ????? equal to EDF. So the point C will also coincide with the
????? ??? ?? ?? ??. ???? ??? ??? ?? ? ??? ?? ? ?????????? point F, again on account of AC being equal to DF. But,
???? ????? ? ?? ??? ????? ??? ?? ?????????. ?? ??? ??? point B certainly also coincided with point E, so that the
??? ? ??? ?? ? ???????????? ??? ?? ? ??? ?? ? ? ?? ????? base BC will coincide with the base EF. For if B coin??? ??? ?? ??? ?????????, ??? ??????? ?????? ???????????? cides with E, and C with F, and the base BC does not
???? ????? ????????. ????????? ??? ? ?? ????? ??? ??? coincide with EF, then two straight-lines will encompass
?? ??? ??? ???? ?????? ???? ??? ???? ?? ??? ???????? an area. The very thing is impossible [Post. 1].‡ Thus,
??? ???? ?? ??? ???????? ????????? ??? ???? ???? ?????, the base BC will coincide with EF, and will be equal to
??? ?? ?????? ?????? ??? ??? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ??? it [C.N. 4]. So the whole triangle ABC will coincide with
???? ?????? ???????, ? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? the whole triangle DEF, and will be equal to it [C.N. 4].
??? ?? ??? ???. And the remaining angles will coincide with the remain-
???? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??????? [????] ??? ing angles, and will be equal to them [C.N. 4]. (That is)
???????? ???? ??? ???????? ??????? ??? ??? ?????? ?? ABC to DEF, and ACB to DFE [C.N. 4].
????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ??????? ????????????, Thus, if two triangles have two sides equal to two
??? ??? ????? ?? ????? ???? ????, ??? ?? ???????? ?? sides, respectively, and have the angle(s) enclosed by the
??????? ???? ?????, ??? ?? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????? equal straight-line equal, then they will also have the base
??????? ???? ??????? ??????? ???????, ??? ?? ?? ???? ??????? equal to the base, and the triangle will be equal to the tri????????????? ???? ???? ??????. angle, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal
sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining angles. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
† The application of one figure to another should be counted as an additional postulate.
‡ Since Post. 1 implicitly assumes that the straight-line joining two given points is unique.

??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?????, ? ?? ??? ??? ?? AC (respectively) [Post. 2]. I say that the angle ABC is

??????? ??? ??? ??? ?? ????? ??????? ?? ?, ??? For let the point F have been taken at random on BD,

11
STOIQEIWN aþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 1
??? ? ??, ??? ???????????? ?? ??, ?? ???????. to the lesser AF [Prop. 1.3]. Also, let the straight-lines
????? ??? ??? ????? ? ??? ?? ?? ?? ? ?? ?? ?? ??, FC and GB have been joined [Post. 1].
??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? ??, ?? ???? ????? ??????? In fact, since AF is equal to AG, and AB to AC,
???????? ??? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ??? ??? ???? ????? the two (straight-lines) FA, AC are equal to the two
??? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ??? ?????, ??? ?? ??? ???????? ?? (straight-lines) GA, AB, respectively. They also encom??? ??????? ???? ?????, ??? ?? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????? pass a common angle, FAG. Thus, the base FC is equal
??????? ???? ??????? ??????? ???????, ??? ?? ?? ???? ??????? to the base GB, and the triangle AFC will be equal to the
????????????, ? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???, ? ?? ??? ??? triangle AGB, and the remaining angles subtendend by
?? ??? ???. ??? ???? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?? ????? ???, ?? the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remain? ?? ?? ?? ????? ???, ????? ??? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ????? ing angles [Prop. 1.4]. (That is) ACF to ABG, and AFC
???. ??????? ?? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ???? to AGB. And since the whole of AF is equal to the whole
???? ??, ?? ???? ????? ??????? ???????? ??? ????? ? ??? of AG, within which AB is equal to AC, the remainder
??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ???, ??? ????? ????? ????? ? ??? BF is thus equal to the remainder CG [C.N. 3]. But FC
??? ?? ??? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ??????? ???? ?????, ??? was also shown (to be) equal to GB. So the two (straight?? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????? ??????? ???? ??????? ??????? lines) BF, FC are equal to the two (straight-lines) CG,
???????, ??? ?? ?? ???? ??????? ????????????? ??? ??? ????? GB, respectively, and the angle BFC (is) equal to the

??????? ???, ?? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ???, ????? ??? ? the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be
??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ????? ???? ??? ???? ???? ?? equal to the corresponding remaining angles [Prop. 1.4].
????? ??? ??? ????????. ??????? ?? ??? ? ??? ??? ?? Thus, FBC is equal to GCB, and BCF to CBG. There??? ??? ???? ??? ????? ??? ??? ?????. fore, since the whole angle ABG was shown (to be) equal

???? ???????? ?????, ??? ??????????????? ??? ???? ??????? BCF, the remainder ABC is thus equal to the remainder
?? ??? ??? ????? ?????? ???? ???????? ???????? ???? ???? ACB [C.N. 3]. And they are at the base of triangle ABC.
??????. And FBC was also shown (to be) equal to GCB. And
they are under the base.
Thus, for isosceles triangles, the angles at the base are
equal to one another, and if the equal sides are produced
then the angles under the base will be equal to one another. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

????? ??? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ?? ????? ?? ? ??, ??? ?? [Prop. 1.3]. And let DC have been joined [Post. 1].

?????????. KD.
????? ??? ???????????????? ???? ?? ????, ????????? For since ABCD is a parallelogram, and AC its diago?? ????? ? ??, ???? ???? ?? ??? ???????? ?? ??? nal, triangle ABC is equal to triangle ACD [Prop. 1.34].
???????. ?????, ???? ???????????????? ???? ?? ??, Again, since EH is a parallelogram, and AK is its diago????????? ?? ????? ????? ? ??, ???? ???? ?? ??? ???????? nal, triangle AEK is equal to triangle AHK [Prop. 1.34].
?? ??? ???????. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ?? ??? ???????? So, for the same (reasons), triangle KFC is also equal to

????????? ?? ? ??????? ???? ???????????????? ?? Let the parallelogram BEFG, equal to the triangle C,

† And let FG have been drawn

??? ??, ?? ?????? ???????? ? ??, ?? ??? ??? ???, ??? parallel to either of BG or EF [Prop. 1.31], and let HB

43
STOIQEIWN aþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 1
??? ???????????? ????????????. ????????????? ??? ???- [Prop. 1.29]. Thus, (the sum of) BHG and GFE is less

????????? ?? ??, ??? ???? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?? ??. ???? KL have been drawn through point K parallel to either
?? ?? ?? ? ??????? ????? ????? ??? ?? ?? ??? ?? ? ????? of EA or FH [Prop. 1.31]. And let HA and GB have

???? ? ??? ??? ?? ? ????? ???, ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ?? ? HLKF is a parallelogram, and HK its diagonal. And
????? ????? ???. AG and ME (are) parallelograms, and LB and BF the
???? ??? ???????? ??? ??????? ??? ?? ?? ??????? so-called complements, about HK. Thus, LB is equal to
??????? ?? ? ???? ???????????????? ???????????? ?? ?? BF [Prop. 1.43]. But, BF is equal to triangle C. Thus,
?? ????? ?? ??? ???, ? ????? ??? ?? ?? ???? ???? ???????. LB is also equal to C. Also, since angle GBE is equal to
ABM [Prop. 1.15], but GBE is equal to D, ABM is thus
also equal to angle D.
Thus, the parallelogram LB, equal to the given triangle C, has been applied to the given straight-line AB in
the angle ABM, which is equal to D. (Which is) the very
thing it was required to do.

????? ?? ??? ????? ??????????? ?? ????, ? ?? Let ABCD be the given rectilinear figure,† and E the

?????????? ? ??, ??? ????????? ?? ??? ??????? Let DB have been joined, and let the parallelogram

????? ??? ?? ?? ??? ???????????? ???? ??? ?? ??????? ?? in the angle HKF, which is equal to E [Prop. 1.42]. And

??? ????? ???. ????? ?????????? ? ??? ???? ?? ??? E is equal to each of (angles) HKF and GHM, (an??? ???, ??? ???? ??? ???, ??? ???? ?????. ???? ?? gle) HKF is thus also equal to GHM. Let KHG have
??? ???, ??? ????? ?????? ???? ?????? ??? ?? ??? ???, been added to both. Thus, (the sum of) FKH and KHG
??? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ?????. ???? ?? ???? ?????? ?? ?? is equal to (the sum of) KHG and GHM. But, (the
??? ?? ???? ???? ?????? ?? ? ??? ??????? ?? ??, ?? ?? sum of) FKH and KHG is equal to two right-angles
??? ?? ???? ???? ???????? ??? ?????? ?????? ??? ?????? [Prop. 1.29]. Thus, (the sum of) KHG and GHM is

?????????????? ????? ??????? ?? ??, ??? ??? ?? ??, ?? HGF and HGL. But, (the sum of) MHG and HGL is

ML [Prop. 1.30]. And the straight-lines KM and FL
join them. Thus, KM and FL are equal and parallel as
well [Prop. 1.33]. Thus, KFLM is a parallelogram. And
since triangle ABD is equal to parallelogram FH, and
DBC to GM, the whole rectilinear figure ABCD is thus
equal to the whole parallelogram KFLM.

????? ?? ?? ?????? ??? ??? ???? ???? ??????? ??? Let AC have been drawn at right-angles to the

??????????? ??? ???? ?? ????? ??? ??? ????? ? ??? ?? AB [Prop. 1.31], and let BE have been drawn through
?? ??, ? ?? ?? ?? ??. ???? ? ?? ?? ?? ????? ???? point B parallel to AD [Prop. 1.31]. Thus, ADEB is a
?? ???????? ??? ?? ??, ??, ??, ?? ???? ???????? ?????? parallelogram. Therefore, AB is equal to DE, and AD to
?????????? ??? ???? ?? ???? ????????????????. ???? BE [Prop. 1.34]. But, AB is equal to AD. Thus, the four
??, ??? ??? ??????????. ???? ??? ??? ??????????? ??? ??, (sides) BA, AD, DE, and EB are equal to one another.
?? ?????? ???????? ? ??, ?? ??? ??? ???, ??? ?????? Thus, the parallelogram ADEB is equilateral. So I say

??? ??????? ??? ?????????? ??? ??? ???, ??? ??????? [Prop. 1.29]. But BAD (is a) right-angle. Thus, ADE
?????????? ??? ???? ?? ????. ??????? ?? ??? ??????????. (is) also a right-angle. And for parallelogrammic figures,
the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another
[Prop. 1.34]. Thus, each of the opposite angles ABE

?????????. Let ABC be a right-angled triangle having the angle

???? ???? ???? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???????????. For let the square BDEC have been described on
???????????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?????????? ?? BC, and (the squares) GB and HC on AB and AC
????, ??? ?? ??? ??, ?? ?? ??, ??, ??? ??? ??? (respectively) [Prop. 1.46]. And let AL have been

???????????? ?? ??, ??. ??? ???? ???? ????? ??????? [Prop. 1.31]. And let AD and FC have been joined. And
??? ??? ???, ??? ??????, ???? ?? ???? ?????? ?? ?? since angles BAC and BAG are each right-angles, then

???? ????????? ??? ??????? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? ?? BA, at the point A on it, (whose sum is) equal to two

????? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ???? ???? ??? ???????? So, for the same (reasons), BA is also straight-on to AH.
????? ?????????? ? ??? ???? ??? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ?? And since angle DBC is equal to FBA, for (they are)
??? ??? ????? ???. ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ??? ?? ?? ??, ? both right-angles, let ABC have been added to both.
?? ?? ?? ??, ??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ??? ???? ??, ?? ???? ????? Thus, the whole (angle) DBA is equal to the whole (an??????? ???????? ??? ????? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? gle) FBC. And since DB is equal to BC, and FB to
???? ????? ??? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? [?????] ???, ??? ?? ??? BA, the two (straight-lines) DB, BA are equal to the

???????? ?? ??? ??????? ????? ????? ??? [????] ??? ??? two (straight-lines) CB, BF,

respectively. And angle
??? ???????? ????????? ?? ?? ????????????????? ????? DBA (is) equal to angle FBC. Thus, the base AD [is]
?? ??? ??? ????? ?????? ??? ?? ??? ?? ???? ?????? ???? equal to the base FC, and the triangle ABD is equal to
??????????? ???? ??, ??? ??? ?? ??? ???????? ????????? the triangle FBC [Prop. 1.4]. And parallelogram BL

??? ?? ??? ?? ???? ?????? ???? ??????????? ???? ??, ??. the same base, BD, and are between the same parallels,
[?? ?? ??? ???? ???????? ??? ???????? ??????] ???? ??? ???? BD and AL [Prop. 1.41]. And square GB is double (the

?? ?????????????? ??? ??, ?? ??????????? ??? ?? ?? base, FB, and are between the same parallels, FB and
???????????????? ???? ?? ?? ?????????? ???? ??? ?? GC [Prop. 1.41]. [And the doubles of equal things are
???? ?????????? ???? ???? ??, ?? ??????????? ???? equal to one another.]‡ Thus, the parallelogram BL is
?????. ??? ???? ?? ??? ???? ?????????? ??? ??? ?? ???- also equal to the square GB. So, similarly, AE and BK
??????, ?? ?? ??, ?? ??? ??? ??, ??. ?? ??? ??? ??? being joined, the parallelogram CL can be shown (to

??????? ???????????. BDEC is equal to the (sum of the) two squares GB and
HC. And the square BDEC is described on BC, and

Thus, the square on the side BC is equal to the (sum of

† Let the

Thus, if the square on one of the sides of a triangle is

sides of the triangle then the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is a right-angle. (Which
is) the very thing it was required to show.

?? ?? ?? ????? ???? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? (angle) ADB [Prop. 1.29]. But, ADB is equal to ABD,
????? ???? ???? ??? ?????? ? ?? ?????? ?? ?? ????? ???? since the side BA is also equal to AD [Prop. 1.5]. Thus,

???? ?? ??? ?? ??? ???? ??? ??? ????????? ???????? ?? the gnomon STU and the (square) OH is (equivalent to)

times the (rectangle contained) by AB and BD, plus the
(square) on AC, is equal to the square on AD. And BD
(is) equal to BC. Thus, four times the rectangle contained by AB and BC, plus the square on AC, is equal to
the (square) on AD, that is to say the square described
on AB and BC, as on one (complete straight-line).
Thus, if a straight-line is cut at random then four times
the rectangle contained by the whole (straight-line), and
one of the pieces (of the straight-line), plus the square
on the remaining piece, is equal to the square described
on the whole and the former piece, as on one (complete

????? ??? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ???? ????? ? ??, ??? and CD.
?????? ??? ??????? ??? ??, ??, ??? ???????????? ?? ??, For let CE have been drawn from (point) C, at right??, ??? ??? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ?????????? ???? ? ??, ??? angles to AB [Prop. 1.11], and let it be made equal to

????? ? ?? ?? ??, ??? ???? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? have been joined. And let DF have been drawn through

??? ??????? ??? ??? ???, ??? ??????? ????? ?????? ??? AC is equal to CE, the angle EAC is also equal to the
??? ? ??? ??? ???? ?????. ??? ???? ? ??? ??? ??????? (angle) AEC [Prop. 1.5]. And since the (angle) at C is
????? ?????, ???? ?? ? ??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ?? ????? ??? a right-angle, the (sum of the) remaining angles (of tri?????????? ?? ??? ???? ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ??????? ????? angle AEC), EAC and AEC, is thus equal to one right59

?????? ??? ??? [?????] ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ???? ???? angle [Prop. 1.32]. And they are equal. Thus, (angles)
??? ?????? ? ?? ?? ?? ????? ???. ????? ???? ? ???? ?? ? CEA and CAE are each half a right-angle. So, for the
????? ??????? ????? ?????, ???? ?? ? ??? ???? ??? ??? same (reasons), (angles) CEB and EBC are also each
????? ???? ?? ????? ??? ?????????? ?? ??? ???? ????? ??? half a right-angle. Thus, the whole (angle) AEB is a
? ??? ??? ??????? ????? ?????? ??? ??? ? ???? ?? ? ????? right-angle. And since GEF is half a right-angle, and
?? ??? ???? ???? ??? ?????? ? ?? ?????? ?? ?? ????? EGF (is) a right-angle—for it is equal to the internal and
???. ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ???? ???? ??? ?? ??? ?? opposite (angle) ECB [Prop. 1.29]—the remaining (an?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????????? ???????? gle) EFG is thus half a right-angle [Prop. 1.32]. Thus,
???? ??? ??? ??. ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? angle GEF [is] equal to EFG. So the side EG is also
??? ?? ??????????? ???? ??? ? ??? ??? ?????? ?? ??? equal to the (side) GF [Prop. 1.6]. Again, since the an??? ??? ?? ????????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??. ?????, ???? ??? gle at B is half a right-angle, and (angle) FDB (is) a
????? ? ?? ?? ??, ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? right-angle—for again it is equal to the internal and op?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????????? ???????? ???? ??? ??? posite (angle) ECB [Prop. 1.29]—the remaining (angle)
??? ?? ??????????. ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??????????? BFD is half a right-angle [Prop. 1.32]. Thus, the angle at
???? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??????????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? B (is) equal to DFB. So the side FD is also equal to the
?????????? ????????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??. ??? ?? ? ?? side DB [Prop. 1.6]. And since AC is equal to CE, the
?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ????????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??. (square) on AC (is) also equal to the (square) on CE.
???? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ????????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?? Thus, the (sum of the) squares on AC and CE is dou??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????????? ???????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ble the (square) on AC. And the square on EA is equal
??, ?? ??????????. ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ???? to the (sum of the) squares on AC and CE. For angle
?? ??? ??? ?? ??????????? ???? ??? ????? ? ??? ??? ACE (is) a right-angle [Prop. 1.47]. Thus, the (square)
?????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?????????? ????????? ???? ??? on EA is double the (square) on AC. Again, since EG
??? ??? ??, ??. ?? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, is equal to GF, the (square) on EG (is) also equal to
??? ???? ??? ? ???? ?? ? ?????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? the (square) on GF. Thus, the (sum of the squares) on

??? ?????? ??? ???? ???????? ????????? ???????? ???? Thus, the (square) on EF is double the (square) on CD.
??? ?? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ????? And the (square) on EA is also double the (square) on
??????????? ???? ???? ??????. AC. Thus, the (sum of the) squares on AE and EF is
double the (sum of the) squares on AC and CD. And
the square on AF is equal to the (sum of the squares)
on AE and EF. For the angle AEF is a right-angle
[Prop. 1.47]. Thus, the square on AF is double the (sum
of the squares) on AC and CD. And the (sum of the
squares) on AD and DF (is) equal to the (square) on
AF. For the angle at D is a right-angle [Prop. 1.47].
Thus, the (sum of the squares) on AD and DF is double
the (sum of the) squares on AC and CD. And DF (is)
equal to DB. Thus, the (sum of the) squares on AD and
DB is double the (sum of the) squares on AC and CD.
Thus, if a straight-line is cut into equal and unequal
(pieces) then the (sum of the) squares on the unequal
pieces of the whole (straight-line) is double the (sum of
the) square on half (the straight-line) and (the square) on
the (difference) between the (equal and unequal) pieces.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

?? ??? ??, ?? ???????????? ??? ?? ?, ? ???? ???- and FD, the (internal angles) CEF and EFD are thus
?????????. ????????????? ??? ????????????? ???? ?? ?, equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.29]. Thus, FEB and

????? ? ?? ?? ??, ???? ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? for it is equal to the opposite (angle) at C [Prop. 1.34],

Thus, if a straight-line is cut in half, and any straightline added to it straight-on, then the sum of the square

????????? ??? ?? ? ?????????? ???? ?????????- For let the right-angled parallelogram BD, equal to

??? ?????? ??? ??????????? ?? ?????? ??? ??????. 2. A straight-line said to touch a circle is any (straight??. ?????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ????- line) which, meeting the circle and being produced, does
????? ??????? ?? ????????? ????????. not cut the circle.
??. ??? ????? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ??????? ??????? 3. Circles said to touch one another are any (circles)
????????, ???? ?? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ????? ??????? which, meeting one another, do not cut one another.
???????? ???? ????. 4. In a circle, straight-lines are said to be equally far
??. ?????? ?? ??????? ???????, ??? ?? ? ?????? ??????? from the center when the perpendiculars drawn to them

????? ? ?????? ?????? ? ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?????? Let ABC be the given circle. So it is required to find

?? ???, ???? ?? ???????, ???? ?? ?, ??? ???????????? half at F [Prop. 1.9]. I say that (point) F is the center of
?? ??, ??, ??. ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ????? ?? ? the [circle] ABC.
??, ??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ??? ???? ??, ?? ???? ????? ??????? For (if) not then, if possible, let G (be the center of the
???????? ??? ????? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ????? ???? ?? ??????? circle), and let GA, GD, and GB have been joined. And
???? ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?????. since AD is equal to DB, and DG (is) common, the two

???? ?? ?????? ??? ??????? ???????? ??? ?????? ?????? (straight-lines) AD, DG are equal to the two (straight???? ???????? ????, ???? ??????? ??? ???? ?????? ?????? lines) BD, DG,

respectively. And the base GA is equal
???? ??? ????? ? ??? ???. ???? ?? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? to the base GB. For (they are both) radii. Thus, angle

the equal angles is a right-angle [Def. 1.10]. Thus, GDB
is a right-angle. And FDB is also a right-angle. Thus,
FDB (is) equal to GDB, the greater to the lesser. The
very thing is impossible. Thus, (point) G is not the center
of the circle ABC. So, similarly, we can show that neither
is any other (point) except F.

bþ. Proposition 2
???? ?????? ??? ??? ??????????? ????? ??? ??????? If two points are taken at random on the circumfer??????, ? ??? ?? ?????? ????????????? ?????? ????? ???????? ence of a circle then the straight-line joining the points

????? ?????? ? ???, ??? ??? ??? ??????????? ????? Let ABC be a circle, and let two points A and B have
??????? ??? ??????? ?????? ?? ?, ?? ????, ??? ? ??? been taken at random on its circumference. I say that the
??? ? ??? ?? ? ????????????? ?????? ????? ???????? ??? straight-line joining A to B will fall inside the circle.
??????. For (if) not then, if possible, let it fall outside (the
?? ???, ???? ?? ???????, ??????? ????? ?? ? ???, ??? circle), like AEB (in the figure). And let the center of
??????? ?? ??????? ??? ??? ??????, ??? ???? ?? ?, ??? the circle ABC have been found [Prop. 3.1], and let it be
???????????? ?? ??, ??, ??? ?????? ? ???. (at point) D. And let DA and DB have been joined, and
????? ??? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ??? ??? ??? ????? ? let DFE have been drawn through.
??? ??? ?? ??? ???? ??? ???? ???????? ??? ??? ??? Therefore, since DA is equal to DB, the angle DAE
71
STOIQEIWN gþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 3
?????? ?????????????? ? ???, ?????? ??? ? ??? ??? (is) thus also equal to DBE [Prop. 1.5]. And since in tri????? ??? ??? ???. ??? ?? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???? angle DAE the one side, AEB, has been produced, an?????? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???. ??? ?? ??? ??????? gle DEB (is) thus greater than DAE [Prop. 1.16]. And
?????? ? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ??? ? ?? ??? DAE (is) equal to DBE [Prop. 1.5]. Thus, DEB (is)
??. ??? ?? ? ?? ?? ??. ?????? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ? greater than DBE. And the greater angle is subtended
??????? ??? ????????? ???? ????? ????????. ??? ??? ? by the greater side [Prop. 1.19]. Thus, DB (is) greater
??? ??? ? ??? ?? ? ????????????? ?????? ????? ???????? than DE. And DB (is) equal to DF. Thus, DF (is)
??? ??????. ?????? ?? ????????, ??? ???? ??? ????? ??? greater than DE, the lesser than the greater. The very
???????????? ????? ???. thing is impossible. Thus, the straight-line joining A to
B will not fall outside the circle. So, similarly, we can
show that neither (will it fall) on the circumference itself.
Thus, (it will fall) inside (the circle).

it was required to show.
gþ. Proposition 3
???? ?? ????? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ??????? ??????? ???? In a circle, if any straight-line through the center cuts
?? ??? ??? ??????? ???? ?????, ??? ???? ????? ????? ??????? in half any straight-line not through the center then it
??? ??? ???? ????? ????? ?????, ??? ???? ????? ??????. also cuts it at right-angles. And (conversely) if it cuts it
????? ?????? ? ???, ??? ?? ???? ?????? ??? ??? ??? at right-angles then it also cuts it in half.
??????? ? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ?? ???? Let ABC be a circle, and, within it, let some straight??????? ???? ?? ? ???????? ????, ??? ??? ???? ????? ????? line through the center, CD, cut in half some straight-line
??????. not through the center, AB, at the point F. I say that
??????? ??? ?? ??????? ??? ??? ??????, ??? ???? (CD) also cuts (AB) at right-angles.
?? ?, ??? ???????????? ?? ??, ??. For let the center of the circle ABC have been found
??? ???? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ????? ?? ? ??, ??? ????? [Prop. 3.1], and let it be (at point) E, and let EA and
???? [?????]? ??? ????? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ???? ????? ??? ? EB have been joined.
??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?????. ???? ?? ?????? ??? And since AF is equal to FB, and FE (is) common,
??????? ???????? ??? ?????? ?????? ???? ???????? ????, two (sides of triangle AFE) [are] equal to two (sides of
???? ??????? ??? ???? ?????? ?????? ??????? ??? ??? triangle BFE). And the base EA (is) equal to the base
??? ???, ??? ???? ?????. ? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??????? EB. Thus, angle AFE is equal to angle BFE [Prop. 1.8].
???? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??????? ????? ???? ???????? ??? And when a straight-line stood upon (another) straight???? ????? ??????. line makes adjacent angles (which are) equal to one another, each of the equal angles is a right-angle [Def. 1.10].
Thus, AFE and BFE are each right-angles. Thus, the
72

(straight-line) CD, which is through the center and cuts
in half the (straight-line) AB, which is not through the
center, also cuts (AB) at right-angles.

??? ??? ????? ????????????????, ???? ??? ????? ? FB.
?? ?? ??, ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???. For, with the same construction, since EA is equal
???? ?? ??? ???? ? ??? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ???? ??? to EB, angle EAF is also equal to EBF [Prop. 1.5].
??? ??????? ???? ???, ??? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ??????? And the right-angle AFE is also equal to the right-angle
???? ?????? ??? ???? ??????? ??? ?????? ???? ?????? ????? BFE. Thus, EAF and EFB are two triangles having

?????? ??? ??????? ???? ??????? ???????? ???? ????? ??? ??? one side—(namely), their common (side) EF, subtend? ?? ?? ??. ing one of the equal angles. Thus, they will also have the
???? ??? ?? ????? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ??????? ??????? remaining sides equal to the (corresponding) remaining
???? ?? ??? ??? ??????? ???? ?????, ??? ???? ????? ????? sides [Prop. 1.26]. Thus, AF (is) equal to FB.
??????? ??? ??? ???? ????? ????? ?????, ??? ???? ????? Thus, in a circle, if any straight-line through the cen??????? ???? ???? ??????. ter cuts in half any straight-line not through the center
then it also cuts it at right-angles. And (conversely) if it
cuts it at right-angles then it also cuts it in half. (Which

dþ. Proposition 4
???? ?? ????? ??? ??????? ???????? ??????? ?? ??? ??? In a circle, if two straight-lines, which are not through
??????? ?????, ?? ????????? ??????? ????. the center, cut one another then they do not cut one an-
????? ?????? ? ????, ??? ?? ???? ??? ??????? ?? ??, other in half.
?? ?????????? ??????? ???? ?? ? ?? ??? ??? ??????? Let ABCD be a circle, and within it, let two straight?????? ????, ??? ?? ????????? ??????? ????. lines, AC and BD, which are not through the center, cut
?? ??? ???????, ?????????? ??????? ???? ???? ???? one another at (point) E. I say that they do not cut one
????? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??, ??? ?? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??????? ?? another in half.
??????? ??? ???? ??????, ??? ???? ?? ?, ??? ????????? For, if possible, let them cut one another in half, such
? ??. that AE is equal to EC, and BE to ED. And let the

?? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ?? ???? ??????, ??? ???? ????? and let it be (at point) F, and let FE have been joined.
????? ??????? ???? ??? ????? ? ??? ???? ?????, ???? ?????? Therefore, since some straight-line through the center,
??? ? ?? ??????? ???? ??? ?? ???? ??????, ??? ???? ????? FE, cuts in half some straight-line not through the cen????? ??????? ???? ??? ? ??? ???. ??????? ?? ??? ? ??? ter, AC, it also cuts it at right-angles [Prop. 3.3]. Thus,

73
STOIQEIWN gþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 3
???????? ???? ????? ????????. ??? ??? ?? ??, ?? ????????? cuts in half some straight-line BD, it also cuts it at right??????? ????. angles [Prop. 3.3]. Thus, FEB (is) a right-angle. But
FEA was also shown (to be) a right-angle. Thus, FEA

For, if possible, let FK

to the (straight-line) through the center equal to the further away. The very thing (is) impossible. Thus, another
(straight-line) equal to GF will not radiate from the point
F towards (the circumference of) the circle. Thus, (there
is) only one (such straight-line).
Thus, if some point, which is not the center of the
circle, is taken on the diameter of a circle, and some
straight-lines radiate from the point towards the (circumference of the) circle, then the greatest (straight-line)
will be that on which the center (lies), and the least
the remainder (of the same diameter). And for the others, a (straight-line) nearer to the (straight-line) through
the center is always greater than a (straight-line) further
away. And only two equal (straight-lines) will radiate
from the same point towards the (circumference of the)
circle, (one) on each (side) of the least (straight-line).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

?????, ???? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ????? ?? ? ??, ?? ??, EM and MD is greater than ED [Prop. 1.20]. Thus,

‡ Thus, the base ED is greater

straight-lines are drawn from the point to the (circumference of the) circle, one of which (passes) through the center, the remainder (being) random, then for the straightlines radiating towards the concave (part of the) circumference, the greatest is that (passing) through the center.
For the others, a (straight-line) nearer to the (straightline) through the center is always greater than one further away. For the straight-lines radiating towards the

squares) on EG and GC, of which the (square) on EF is
equal to the (square) on EG. For EF (is) equal to EG.
Thus, the remaining (square) on AF is equal to the (remaining square) on CG. Thus, AF (is) equal to CG. And
AB is double AF, and CD double CG. Thus, AB (is)
equal to CD.
Thus, in a circle, equal straight-lines are equally far
from the center, and (straight-lines) which are equally far
from the center are equal to one another. (Which is) the
very thing it was required to show.

the base MN is thus greater than the base FG

??????? ??? ?? ??????? ??? ?????? ?? ?, ??? For let the center E of the circle have been found
????????? ? ??, ??? ?????? ??? ?? ? ?????????? ?? ?? [Prop. 3.1], and let AE have been joined. And let (the

????? ??? ?? ? ??????? ???? ??? ???, ??? ??????, been drawn from point A touching circle BCD.
??? ??? ????? ? ??? ?? ?? ??, ? ?? ?? ?? ??? ??? ?? For since E is the center of circles BCD and AFG,
?? ??, ?? ??? ???? ??, ?? ???? ?????? ??? ?????? ?????? EA is thus equal to EF, and ED to EB. So the two
?????????? ??? ???? ?? ?? ????? ??? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? (straight-lines) AE, EB are equal to the two (straight??? ?????, ??? ?? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ??????? ???? lines) FE, ED (respectively). And they contain a com?????, ??? ?? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????? ???????? ??? ??? ? mon angle at E. Thus, the base DF is equal to the

[Prop. 3.16 corr.]. Thus, AB touches circle BCD.
Thus, the straight-line AB has been drawn touching

the given circle BCD from the given point A. (Which is)
the very thing it was required to do.

?????????? ?????? ??? ? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ? ?? ?? ??? FCG is thus acute [Prop. 1.17]. And the greater angle is

Thus, if some straight-line touches a circle, and some

?? ???? ??? ??? ?????? ??????????, ??? ?? ?? ???? ????? corr.]. And angle BAD is equal to the angle in segment
???? ? ??, ??? ???????? ????? ? ?? ???? ???? ?? ?, ??? AEB. For (the latter angle), being in a semi-circle, is also
?? ?? ???? ????? ???? ? ??, ??? ????????? ? ??. a right-angle [Prop. 3.31]. But, BAD is also equal to C.
??? ???? ????? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ??? ????? ? ??, Thus, the (angle) in (segment) AEB is also equal to C.
??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ??? ???? ??, ?? ???? ?????? ??? ????? ? Thus, a segment AEB of a circle, accepting an angle
??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ???? ????? ??? ? ?? ????? equal to C, has again been drawn on AB.
?? ?? ??? ?????? ? ??? ?????? ??? ?? ? ?????????? ?? ?? And so let (angle) C be obtuse. And let (angle) BAD,
?? ?????? ?????????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ?. ??????? ?? ? equal to (C), have been constructed on the straight-line
???. ??? ???? ?? ?? ???????? ??? ????? ???? ????? ????? AB, at the point A (on it) [Prop. 1.23], as in the third
? ??, ? ?? ??? ????????? ??? ??? ??????. ??? ??? ??? diagram (from the left). And let AE have been drawn, at

??????????? ?????. ???? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ???? ?? ? drawn, at right-angles to AB [Prop. 1.10]. And let GB
??? ?????. ??? ? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??????? ????? ??? ???? ?? have been joined.
???? ?? ?. And again, since AF is equal to FB, and FG (is)
???? ??? ??? ???????? ??????? ??? ?? ????????? ????? common, the two (straight-lines) AF, FG are equal to
?????? ?? ??? ????????? ?????? ???? ?? ???? ?? ?? ???? the two (straight-lines) BF, FG (respectively). And an???? ???????. gle AFG (is) equal to angle BFG. Thus, the base AG is
102
STOIQEIWN gþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 3
equal to the base BG [Prop. 1.4]. Thus, a circle of center
G, and radius GA, being drawn, will also go through B
(as well as A). Let it go like AEB (in the third diagram
from the left). And since AD is at right-angles to the diameter AE, at its extremity, AD thus touches circle AEB
[Prop. 3.16 corr.]. And AB has been drawn across (the
circle) from the point of contact A. Thus, angle BAD is
equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment
AHB of the circle [Prop. 3.32]. But, angle BAD is equal
to C. Thus, the angle in segment AHB is also equal to
C.
Thus, a segment AHB of a circle, accepting an angle
equal to C, has been drawn on the given straight-line AB.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to do.

????? ? ?????? ?????? ? ?????? ??? ?? ???? ??? Let ABCDE be the given circle. So it is required
????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ?? ??? ????????? to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon
??????????. about circle ABCDE.
???????? ??? ????????????? ?????????? ??? ?????? Let A, B, C, D, and E have been conceived as the an?????? ?? ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ???? ???? ????? ??? ??, ??, gular points of a pentagon having been inscribed (in cir??, ??, ?? ???????????? ??? ??? ??? ?, ?, ?, ?, ? cle ABCDE) [Prop. 3.11], such that the circumferences
??????? ??? ?????? ??????????? ?? ??, ??, ??, ??, AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA are equal. And let GH, HK,
??, ??? ??????? ??? ????? ?????? ??????? ?? ?, ??? KL, LM, and MG have been drawn through (points) A,
???????????? ?? ??, ??, ??, ??, ??. B, C, D, and E (respectively), touching the circle.† And
??? ???? ? ??? ?? ?????? ????????? ??? ????? ???? let the center F of the circle ABCDE have been found
?? ?, ??? ?? ??? ? ??????? ??? ??? ???? ?? ? ?????? [Prop. 3.1]. And let FB, FK, FC, FL, and FD have
?????????? ? ??, ? ?? ??? ??????? ????? ??? ??? ??? ???? been joined.
??? ????? ??????? ??? ???? ?? ? ??????. ??? ?? ???? ?? And since the straight-line KL touches (circle) ABCDE
??? ?? ???? ???? ?, ? ???????? ?????? ????? ?????. ??? ???? at C, and FC has been joined from the center F to the
???? ????? ? ??? ??? ?????, ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???? point of contact C, FC is thus perpendicular to KL
???? ??? ??? ??, ??. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ???? ??? ??? ??, [Prop. 3.18]. Thus, each of the angles at C is a right?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? angle. So, for the same (reasons), the angles at B and
???? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????? ???, ?? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? D are also right-angles. And since angle FCK is a right??? ?? ????? ????? ?????? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? angle, the (square) on FK is thus equal to the (sum of
?? ????? ????. ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? ???? ??? ????? the squares) on FC and CK [Prop. 1.47]. So, for the
? ?? ?? ??, ??? ????? ? ??, ??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? same (reasons), the (square) on FK is also equal to the
??, ?? ???? ?????? ??? ????? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? [?????] ???? (sum of the squares) on FB and BK. So that the (sum
????? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? [?????] ?? ??? ??? ????? ???? of the squares) on FC and CK is equal to the (sum of
? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???? ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ??? the squares) on FB and BK, of which the (square) on
??? ???, ? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? FC is equal to the (square) on FB. Thus, the remain? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ?????, ? ?? ??? ??? ing (square) on CK is equal to the remaining (square)
??? ??? ???. ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ?? ?????????? ?? ??, on BK. Thus, BK (is) equal to CK. And since FB is
??? ???? ??? ????? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???. ??? ????? ? equal to FC, and FK (is) common, the two (straight??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????, ? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? lines) BF, FK are equal to the two (straight-lines) CF,
???? ??? ??? ??? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???? ???? ?? ??? ? FK. And the base BK [is] equal to the base CK. Thus,
??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ???. ??? ?? ??????? ???? ?? angle BFK is equal to [angle] KFC [Prop. 1.8]. And
???, ??? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ???? ??????? ???? ?????? BKF (is equal) to FKC [Prop. 1.8]. Thus, BFC (is)
??? ???? ??????? ??? ?????? ???? ?????? ????? ??? ??? double KFC, and BKC (is double) FKC. So, for the
??? ??? ?????? ??? ??????? ???? ??????? ???????? ???? ???? same (reasons), CFD is also double CFL, and DLC (is
??? ??? ?????? ?????? ?? ????? ?????? ??? ??? ? ??? ?? also double) FLC. And since circumference BC is equal
?????? ?? ??, ? ?? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ???. ??? ???? ??? to CD, angle BFC is also equal to CFD [Prop. 3.27].
????? ? ?? ?? ??, ????? ??? ? ?? ??? ??. ??? ?? ???? ?? And BFC is double KFC, and DFC (is double) LFC.
??????????? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????. ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ?? Thus, KFC is also equal to LFC. And angle FCK is also
???? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?? ????? ???. ?????? ?? ??????????? equal to FCL. So, FKC and FLC are two triangles hav121
STOIQEIWN dþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 4
??? ?????? ??? ??, ??, ?? ??????? ??? ??, ?? ???? ing two angles equal to two angles, and one side equal
?????????? ??? ???? ?? ????? ??????????. ???? ??, to one side, (namely) their common (side) FC. Thus,
??? ??? ?????????. ???? ??? ??? ????? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? they will also have the remaining sides equal to the (cor??? ???, ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ? ??? ???, responding) remaining sides, and the remaining angle to
??? ?? ??? ??? ????? ? ??? ???, ??? ? ??? ??? ??? the remaining angle [Prop. 1.26]. Thus, the straight-line
?? ??? ??? ????? ???. ?????? ?? ??????????? ??? ?????? KC (is) equal to CL, and the angle FKC to FLC. And
??? ??? ???, ???, ??? ??????? ??? ??? ???, ??? since KC is equal to CL, KL (is) thus double KC. So,
???? ?? ????? ??? ?????? ?? ??? ???, ???, ???, ???, for the same (reasons), it can be shown that HK (is) also
??? ???? ???????? ?????. ????????? ??? ???? ?? ????? double BK. And BK is equal to KC. Thus, HK is also
??????????. ??????? ?? ??? ??????????, ??? ????????????? equal to KL. So, similarly, each of HG, GM, and ML
???? ??? ????? ??????. can also be shown (to be) equal to each of HK and KL.
[???? ??? ??????? ??? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? Thus, pentagon GHKLM is equilateral. So I say that
?? ??? ????????? ?????????????]? ???? ???? ???????. (it is) also equiangular. For since angle FKC is equal to
FLC, and HKL was shown (to be) double FKC, and
KLM double FLC, HKL is thus also equal to KLM.
So, similarly, each of KHG, HGM, and GML can also
be shown (to be) equal to each of HKL and KLM. Thus,
the five angles GHK, HKL, KLM, LMG, and MGH
are equal to one another. Thus, the pentagon GHKLM
is equiangular. And it was also shown (to be) equilateral,
and has been circumscribed about circle ABCDE.
[Thus, an equilateral and equiangular pentagon has
been circumscribed about the given circle]. (Which is)
the very thing it was required to do.

????? ?? ????? ?????????? ?????????? ?? ??? ???????- Let ABCDE be the given equilateral and equiangular

???????? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ???, ??? ?????? For let angles BCD and CDE have each been cut
???? ??? ???????? ??? ??, ?? ???????? ??? ??? ??? ? in half by each of the straight-lines CF and DF (re???????, ???? ? ???????????? ???????? ?? ??, ?? ???????, spectively) [Prop. 1.9]. And from the point F, at which
???????????? ?? ??, ??, ?? ???????. ??? ???? ??? ????? the straight-lines CF and DF meet one another, let the
122
STOIQEIWN dþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 4
? ?? ?? ??, ????? ?? ? ??, ??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? straight-lines FB, FA, and FE have been joined. And
??, ?? ???? ?????? ??? ????? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? since BC is equal to CD, and CF (is) common, the two
??? [?????] ???? ????? ??? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ????? ???, (straight-lines) BC, CF are equal to the two (straight??? ?? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ??????? ????? ????, ??? ?? lines) DC, CF. And angle BCF [is] equal to angle
?????? ?????? ???? ??????? ??????? ???? ???????, ??? ?? ?? DCF. Thus, the base BF is equal to the base DF, and
???? ??????? ????????????? ??? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? triangle BCF is equal to triangle DCF, and the remain??? ???. ??? ???? ????? ????? ? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???, ing angles will be equal to the (corresponding) remain??? ?? ? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???, ? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ing angles which the equal sides subtend [Prop. 1.4].
???, ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ?????? ??? Thus, angle CBF (is) equal to CDF. And since CDE
??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ???? ? ??? ??? ??? ????? is double CDF, and CDE (is) equal to ABC, and CDF
???? ???????? ??? ??? ?? ???????. ?????? ?? ???????????, to CBF, CBA is thus also double CBF. Thus, angle
??? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ???, ??? ???? ???????? ??? ABF is equal to FBC. Thus, angle ABC has been cut
???????? ??? ??, ?? ???????. ??????? ?? ??? ??? ? in half by the straight-line BF. So, similarly, it can be
??????? ??? ??? ??, ??, ??, ??, ?? ??????? ??????? shown that BAE and AED have been cut in half by the
?? ??, ??, ??, ??, ??. ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ??? ??? straight-lines FA and FE, respectively. So let FG, FH,
????? ?? ??? ???, ???? ?? ??? ???? ? ??? ??? [????] FK, FL, and FM have been drawn from point F, per?? ??? ??? ???, ??? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ???, ??? ??? pendicular to the straight-lines AB, BC, CD, DE, and
??? ?????? ???? ??????? ???? ?????? ??? ???? ??????? ??? EA (respectively) [Prop. 1.12]. And since angle HCF
?????? ???? ?????? ????? ??? ?? ???????????? ??? ???? is equal to KCF, and the right-angle FHC is also equal
??? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ??????? ???? ??????? to the [right-angle] FKC, FHC and FKC are two tri???????? ???? ????? ??? ??? ? ?? ??????? ?? ?? ??????. angles having two angles equal to two angles, and one
?????? ?? ???????????, ??? ??? ?????? ??? ??, ??, ?? side equal to one side, (namely) their common (side) FC,
??????? ??? ??, ?? ??? ?????? ?? ????? ??? ??????? ?? ??, subtending one of the equal angles. Thus, they will also
??, ??, ??, ?? ???? ???????? ?????. ? ??? ?????? ?? ? have the remaining sides equal to the (corresponding)
?????????? ?? ??? ??? ?, ?, ?, ?, ? ?????? ?????????? remaining sides [Prop. 1.26]. Thus, the perpendicular
???? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ??????? ??? ???????? ??? ??, ??, FH (is) equal to the perpendicular FK. So, similarly, it
??, ??, ?? ??????? ??? ?? ????? ????? ??? ???? ???? ?, can be shown that FL, FM, and FG are each equal to
?, ?, ?, ? ???????? ??????. ?? ??? ??? ???????? ?????, each of FH and FK. Thus, the five straight-lines FG,
???? ????? ?????, ?????????? ??? ?? ???????? ??? ?????? FH, FK, FL, and FM are equal to one another. Thus,
???? ????? ??? ????? ???????? ????? ??????? ??? ??????? the circle drawn with center F, and radius one of G, H,
???? ?????? ???????. ??? ??? ? ?????? ?? ? ?????????? ?? K, L, or M, will also go through the remaining points,
??? ??? ?, ?, ?, ?, ? ??????? ?????????? ?????? ????? and will touch the straight-lines AB, BC, CD, DE, and
??? ??, ??, ??, ??, ?? ???????? ???????? ??? ?????. EA, on account of the angles at points G, H, K, L, and
???????? ?? ? ?????. M being right-angles. For if it does not touch them, but
??? ??? ?? ????? ??????????, ? ????? ?????????? ?? cuts them, it follows that a (straight-line) drawn at right??? ?????????, ?????? ???????????? ???? ???? ???????. angles to the diameter of the circle, from its extremity,
falls inside the circle. The very thing was shown (to be)
absurd [Prop. 3.16]. Thus, the circle drawn with center
F, and radius one of G, H, K, L, or M, does not cut
the straight-lines AB, BC, CD, DE, or EA. Thus, it will
touch them. Let it have been drawn, like GHKLM (in
the figure).
Thus, a circle has been inscribed in the given pentagon which is equilateral and equiangular. (Which is)
the very thing it was required to do.

???????. ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ???, that angles CBA, BAE, and AED have also been cut
??? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??????? ? ??? ???, ??? ?? ??? in half by the straight-lines FB, FA, and FE, respec??? ??????? ? ??? ???, ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? tively. And since angle BCD is equal to CDE, and FCD
????? ???? ???? ??? ?????? ? ?? ?????? ?? ?? ????? ???. is half of BCD, and CDF half of CDE, FCD is thus
?????? ?? ???????????, ??? ??? ?????? ??? ??, ??, ?? also equal to FDC. So that side FC is also equal to side
??????? ??? ??, ?? ????? ???? ?? ????? ??? ??????? ?? FD [Prop. 1.6]. So, similarly, it can be shown that FB,
??, ??, ??, ??, ?? ???? ???????? ?????. ? ??? ?????? FA, and FE are also each equal to each of FC and FD.
?? ? ??? ?????????? ??? ??? ??, ??, ??, ??, ?? ?????? Thus, the five straight-lines FA, FB, FC, FD, and FE

Thus, a circle has been circumscribed about the given

????? ??? ?? ? ??????? ??????? ???? ??? ?????? For since point G is the center of circle ABCDEF,
??????, ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??. ?????, ???? ?? ? ??????? GE is equal to GD. Again, since point D is the cen??????? ???? ??? ??? ??????, ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??. ter of circle GCH, DE is equal to DG. But, GE was
???? ? ?? ?? ?? ??????? ???? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??? shown (to be) equal to GD. Thus, GE is also equal to
?????? ?????????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ????????? ??? ?? ????? ED. Thus, triangle EGD is equilateral. Thus, its three
??? ????? ?????? ?? ??? ???, ???, ??? ???? ???????? angles EGD, GDE, and DEG are also equal to one an?????, ????????? ??? ????????? ???????? ?? ???? ?? ????? other, inasmuch as the angles at the base of isosceles tri?????? ???? ???????? ?????? ??? ????? ?? ????? ??? ???????? angles are equal to one another [Prop. 1.5]. And the
?????? ????? ?????? ????? ? ??? ??? ??? ????? ?????? ???? three angles of the triangle are equal to two right-angles
??? ?????. ?????? ?? ??????????? ??? ? ??? ??? ?????? [Prop. 1.32]. Thus, angle EGD is one third of two right??? ?????. ??? ???? ? ?? ?????? ??? ??? ?? ???????? ??? angles. So, similarly, DGC can also be shown (to be)
?????? ?????? ??? ??? ???, ??? ????? ?????? ???? ?????, one third of two right-angles. And since the straight-line
??? ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ?????? ?? ??? CG, standing on EB, makes adjacent angles EGC and
??? ???, ???, ??? ?????? ???? ???????? ?????? ???? ??? CGB equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.13], the remain?? ???? ??????? ?????? ?? ??? ???, ???, ??? ???? ????? ing angle CGB is thus also one third of two right-angles.
[???? ??? ???, ???, ???]. ?? ?? ??? ?????? ?? ??? ???, Thus, angles EGD, DGC, and CGB are equal to one an???, ???, ???, ???, ??? ???? ???????? ?????. ?? ?? other. And hence the (angles) opposite to them BGA,
???? ?????? ??? ???? ??????????? ?????????? ?? ?? ??? ??- AGF, and FGE are also equal [to EGD, DGC, and
????????? ?? ??, ??, ??, ??, ??, ?? ???? ???????? ?????. CGB (respectively)] [Prop. 1.15]. Thus, the six angles
??? ?? ??? ???? ??????????? ?? ???? ??????? ????????????? EGD, DGC, CGB, BGA, AGF, and FGE are equal
?? ?? ??? ??????? ???? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ??? ???? to one another. And equal angles stand on equal cir?? ?????? ????????. ???? ??, ??? ??? ?????????. ???? cumferences [Prop. 3.26]. Thus, the six circumferences
??? ??? ????? ? ?? ?????????? ?? ?? ??????????, ????? AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA are equal to one an?????????? ? ???? ??????????? ??? ??? ? ????? ??? other. And equal circumferences are subtended by equal
?? ????? ????? ???? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ????? straight-lines [Prop. 3.29]. Thus, the six straight-lines
??????????? ? ??? ??? ?????, ??? ?? ??? ????? ????- (AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA) are equal to one
??????? ? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? another. Thus, hexagon ABCDEF is equilateral. So,
??? ???. ?????? ?? ???????????, ??? ??? ?? ?????? ?????? I say that (it is) also equiangular. For since circumfer??? ?????? ???????? ???? ???? ???? ????? ??????? ??? ence FA is equal to circumference ED, let circumference
??? ???, ??? ??????? ????????? ??? ???? ?? ?????? ABCD have been added to both. Thus, the whole of
????????. ??????? ?? ??? ??????????? ??? ??????????? ??? FABCD is equal to the whole of EDCBA. And angle
??? ?????? ??????. FED stands on circumference FABCD, and angle AFE
??? ??? ??? ??????? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ?? on circumference EDCBA. Thus, angle AFE is equal
125
STOIQEIWN dþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 4
??? ????????? ???????????? ???? ???? ???????. to DEF [Prop. 3.27]. Similarly, it can also be shown
that the remaining angles of hexagon ABCDEF are individually equal to each of the angles AFE and FED.
Thus, hexagon ABCDEF is equiangular. And it was also
shown (to be) equilateral. And it has been inscribed in
circle ABCDE.
Thus, an equilateral and equiangular hexagon has
been inscribed in the given circle. (Which is) the very
thing it was required to do.

????? ??? ?????? ???? ?? ?? ??? ?, ?????? ?? ? ???? For since AB is greater than C, let BE be made equal
?? ??? ?? ?? ??????? ??? ??, ?? ?????????????????? to C. So, the lesser of AE and EB, being multiplied, will
????? ???? ??? ? ??????. ???? ???????? ?? ?? ??????? sometimes be greater than D [Def. 5.4]. First of all, let
??? ??, ??? ???????????????? ?? ??, ??? ???? ????? AE be less than EB, and let AE have been multiplied,
???????????? ?? ?? ?????? ?? ??? ?, ??? ?????????? ???? and let FG be a multiple of it which (is) greater than
?? ?? ??? ??, ?????????????? ???????? ??? ?? ??? ?? D. And as many times as FG is (divisible) by AE, so
??? ?? ?? ?? ? ??? ?? ??? ??????? ??? ? ????????? ??? many times let GH also have become (divisible) by EB,
?? ?, ?????????? ?? ?? ?, ??? ???? ??? ??????, ??? ?? ?? and K by C. And let the double multiple L of D have
???????????? ???????????? ??? ??????? ??? ?, ?????? ?? been taken, and the triple multiple M, and several more,
?????? ??? ?. ???????, ??? ???? ?? ? ???????????? ??? (each increasing) in order by one, until the (multiple)
??? ?, ?????? ?? ?????? ??? ?. taken becomes the first multiple of D (which is) greater
????? ??? ?? ? ??? ? ?????? ????? ???????, ?? ? ??? than K. Let it have been taken, and let it also be the
??? ? ??? ????? ???????. ??? ???? ?????? ???? ???????????? quadruple multiple N of D—the first (multiple) greater
?? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??, ?????? ??? ???? ???- than K.
????????? ?? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??. ?????? ?? Therefore, since K is less than N first, K is thus not
???? ???????????? ?? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? ? ??? ?? ?????? less than M. And since FG and GH are equal multi??? ???? ???????????? ?? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? ? ??? ?. ?? ples of AE and EB (respectively), FG and FH are thus
??, ? ??? ??? ??, ? ?????? ???? ???????????. ?????, ???? equal multiples of AE and AB (respectively) [Prop. 5.1].
?????? ???? ???????????? ?? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? ? ??? ?, And FG and K are equal multiples of AE and C (re???? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?, ???? ??? ??? ?? ?? ?? ?. ?? ?? ? spectively). Thus, FH and K are equal multiples of AB
??? ? ??? ????? ???????? ???? ??? ?? ?? ??? ? ??????? and C (respectively). Thus, FH, K are equal multiples
?????. ?????? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?? ???? ??? ?? ?? ?????- of AB, C. Again, since GH and K are equal multiples
??????? ??? ?, ? ?????? ?????. ???? ??????????? ?? ?, of EB and C, and EB (is) equal to C, GH (is) thus also
? ?? ? ????? ???, ????????? ?? ? ??? ? ?????????? ?????, equal to K. And K is not less than M. Thus, GH not less
??????????? ?? ?? ?, ? ??? ? ???? ???????????, ???? ?? than M either. And FG (is) greater than D. Thus, the
??? ?? ? ??? ? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ?? ?, ? whole of FH is greater than D and M (added) together.
?? ? ??? ?????. ???? ?? ?? ??? ?, ? ?????? ?????? ?? But, D and M (added) together is equal to N, inasmuch
?? ??? ??? ? ????????? ?? ?? ? ??? ? ??? ????????. ??? as M is three times D, and M and D (added) together is
???? ?? ??? ??, ? ??? ??, ? ?????? ???????????, ?? ?? ? four times D, and N is also four times D. Thus, M and D
??? ? ????, ? ??????, ????????????? ?? ?? ??? ???? ?? (added) together is equal to N. But, FH is greater than
? ??????? ????? ???? ???? ?? ? ???? ?? ?. M and D. Thus, FH exceeds N. And K does not exceed
???? ??, ??? ??? ?? ? ???? ?? ? ??????? ????? ???? N. And FH, K are equal multiples of AB, C, and N
???? ?? ? ???? ?? ??. another random multiple of D. Thus, AB has a greater
??? ??? ????? ???????????????? ?????? ????????, ratio to D than C (has) to D [Def. 5.7].
??? ?? ??? ? ??? ? ????????, ?? ?? ? ??? ?? ??? ????????. So, I say that D also has a greater ratio to C than D
??? ???? ?? ??? ? ??? ? ????????????, ?? ?? ??, ? ??? (has) to AB.
??, ? ????, ? ??????, ?????? ???????????? ?? ? ??? ???? For, similarly, by the same construction, we can show
?? ? ??????? ????? ???? ???? ?? ? ???? ?? ??. that N exceeds K, and N does not exceed FH. And
????? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ????. ?? ?? ??????? N is a multiple of D, and FH, K other random equal
?? ?? ?????????????????? ????? ???? ??? ? ??????. ??- multiples of AB, C (respectively). Thus, D has a greater
139
STOIQEIWN eþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 5
??????????????, ??? ???? ?? ?? ???????????? ??? ??? ratio to C than D (has) to AB [Def. 5.5].
??, ?????? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?????????? ???? ?? ?? ??? ??, And so let AE be greater than EB. So, the lesser,
?????????????? ???????? ??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??, ?? ?? ? EB, being multiplied, will sometimes be greater than D.
??? ?. ?????? ?? ????????, ??? ?? ??, ? ??? ??, ? ?????? Let it have been multiplied, and let GH be a multiple of
???? ???????????? ??? ??????? ?????? ?? ? ???????????? EB (which is) greater than D. And as many times as
??? ??? ?, ?????? ?? ?????? ??? ??? ???? ????? ?? ?? GH is (divisible) by EB, so many times let FG also have
??? ? ??? ????? ???????. ?????? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?? ???? become (divisible) by AE, and K by C. So, similarly
??? ?? ?? ??? ?, ?, ???????? ??? ?, ????????. ?? ?? ? (to the above), we can show that FH and K are equal
??? ? ??? ????????, ????????? ??? ?? ?? ?????? ?? ??? multiples of AB and C (respectively). And, similarly (to
??, ???????? ??? ?, ??? ? ??? ????????. ??? ??????? the above), let the multiple N of D, (which is) the first
???????????????? ???? ????? ?????????? ??? ?????????. (multiple) greater than FG, have been taken. So, FG
??? ??? ?????? ??????? ?? ?????? ???? ?? ???? is again not less than M. And GH (is) greater than D.
??????? ????? ???? ???? ?? ???????? ??? ?? ???? ???? ?? Thus, the whole of FH exceeds D and M, that is to say
??????? ??????? ????? ???? ???? ???? ?? ??????? ???? ???? N. And K does not exceed N, inasmuch as FG, which
??????. (is) greater than GH—that is to say, K—also does not
exceed N. And, following the above (arguments), we
(can) complete the proof in the same manner.
Thus, for unequal magnitudes, the greater (magnitude) has a greater ratio than the lesser to the same (magnitude). And the latter (magnitude) has a greater ratio to
the lesser (magnitude) than to the greater. (Which is) the
very thing it was required to show.

??? ?? ??? ??? ????? ???. ?????, ???? ??? ??????????? be) equal to BAD. Thus, (angle) BAD is also equal to
??? ??, ?? ?????? ???????? ? ???, ? ????? ????? ? ??? ACE. Again, since the straight-line BAE falls across the
??? ??? ???? ?? ????? ?? ??? ???. ??????? ?? ??? ? ??? parallel (straight-lines) AD and EC, the external angle

??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??. ??? ?? ? ?? ?? ??? ?? ??? been drawn parallel to one of the sides EC of triangle
? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??. BCE, thus, proportionally, as BD is to DC, so BA (is)

???? ??? ??, ????? ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??? ???????? For, by the same construction, since as BD is to DC,
??? ??? ??? ???? ???? ??? ?? ????? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ? so BA (is) to AC, then also as BD (is) to DC, so BA is
?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??. ??? ??? ? ?? to AE. For AD has been drawn parallel to one (of the

?? ??? ??? ?? ??????? ?? ??? ??? ????? ???? ??? ? ??? (is) equal to AE [Prop. 5.9]. And, hence, angle AEC
??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ????? ???. ? ??? ??? ??? ????? is equal to ACE [Prop. 1.5]. But, AEC [is] equal to the
???? ???????? ??? ??? ?? ???????. external (angle) BAD, and ACE is equal to the alternate
???? ??? ???????? ? ????? ???? ?????, ? ?? ???????? (angle) CAD [Prop. 1.29]. Thus, (angle) BAD is also
??? ?????? ?????? ????? ??? ??? ?????, ?? ??? ?????? equal to CAD. Thus, angle BAC has been cut in half by
??????? ??? ????? ???? ????? ???? ??????? ??? ???????? the straight-line AD.
????????? ??? ??? ?? ??? ?????? ??????? ??? ????? ??? Thus, if an angle of a triangle is cut in half, and the
????? ???? ??????? ??? ???????? ????????, ? ??? ??? ??- straight-line cutting the angle also cuts the base, then the
????? ??? ??? ????? ????????????? ?????? ???? ?????? ??? segments of the base will have the same ratio as the re??? ???????? ??????? ???? ???? ??????. maining sides of the triangle. And if the segments of the
base have the same ratio as the remaining sides of the
triangle, then the straight-line joining the vertex to the
cutting (point) will cut the angle of the triangle in half.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
† The fact that the two straight-lines meet follows because the sum of ACE and CAE is less than two right-angles, as can easily be demonstrated.

?? ???? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? ???? ???????? ??? ??, ?? ??? to BG, so DE (is) to EF [Prop. 6.4]. And as DE (is) to
????? ???? ?????? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??. ???? ??? ????? ? EF, [so] it was assumed (is) AB to BC. Thus, AB has
???? ?? ? ????? ?? ??? ??? ????? ???. ??????? ?? ????? the same ratio to each of BC and BG [Prop. 5.11]. Thus,
????????? ? ???? ?? ?? ??????? ??? ????? ????? ??? ??? BC (is) equal to BG [Prop. 5.9]. And, hence, the angle

????? ??????. ??? ??? ?????? ????? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? adjacent angle to it, AGB, is greater than a right-angle
??? ???? ??? ???. ???? ?? ??? ? ???? ?? ? ??? ?? ???? ?? [Prop. 1.13]. And (AGB) was shown to be equal to the

????????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ???????. right-angle. But it was assumed (to be) less than a right-
????? ?? ????? ????????? ??????? ??? ???? ???? ?, ? ?? angle. The very thing is absurd. Thus, angle ABC is not

?? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ???????. (angle) at A is also equal to the (angle) at D. And thus
??? ??? ????? ???????????????? ?????? ????????, the remaining (angle) at C is equal to the remaining (an??? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ???? ?? ? ?? gle) at F [Prop. 1.32]. Thus, triangle ABC is equiangular
??? ??? ??? ?????. ??? ??????? ?? ????? ? ???? ?? ?? to triangle DEF.

????? ????????. ??? ??? ????? ?????? ????? ? ??? ??? that triangle ABC is equiangular to triangle DEF in this
????? ?? ??? ???? ??? ???. ???? ?? ??? ? ???? ?? ? ?? case also.
???? ?? ? ???? ????? ??? ? ???? ?? ? ????? ?? ???? ?? ? For, with the same construction, we can similarly
??? ?????. ????????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ???????? ?? ??? show that BC is equal to BG. Hence, also, the angle
???????. at C is equal to (angle) BGC. And the (angle) at C (is)
???? ??? ??? ??????? ???? ?????? ??? ????? ???? ???, not less than a right-angle. Thus, BGC (is) not less than
???? ?? ????? ?????? ??? ??????? ????????, ??? ?? ?????? a right-angle either. So, in triangle BGC the (sum of)
???????? ??? ???????? ? ?? ???????? ?????, ???????? two angles is not less than two right-angles. The very
????? ?? ??????? ??? ???? ???? ??? ??????, ???? ?? ???????? thing is impossible [Prop. 1.17]. Thus, again, angle ABC
????? ?? ???????? ???? ???? ??????. is not unequal to DEF. Thus, (it is) equal. And the (angle) at A is also equal to the (angle) at D. Thus, the
remaining (angle) at C is equal to the remaining (angle)
at F [Prop. 1.32]. Thus, triangle ABC is equiangular to
triangle DEF.
Thus, if two triangles have one angle equal to one
angle, and the sides about other angles proportional, and
the remaining angles both less than, or both not less than,
right-angles, then the triangles will be equiangular, and
will have the angles about which the sides (are) proportional equal. (Which is) the very thing it was required to

?? ??? ???????. ????? ??? ?? ? ?? ??????????? ??? [Prop. 1.32]. Thus, triangle ABC is equiangular to tri????? ??? ??? ???????? ???? ??? ?? ???????????? ??? angle ABD. Thus, as BC, subtending the right-angle in
????? ??? ??? ????????, ????? ???? ? ?? ??????????? triangle ABC, is to BA, subtending the right-angle in tri??? ???? ?? ? ?????? ??? ??? ???????? ???? ??? ?? angle ABD, so the same AB, subtending the angle at C

the gnomon V WU. But, gnomon V WU was shown (to

Thus, the parallelogram ST , equal to the given rectilinear figure C, has been applied to the given straightline AB, falling short by the parallelogrammic figure QB,

† and if (BL is) less (than EN then BGL is

Thus, in equal circles, angles have the same ratio as
the (ratio of the) circumferences on which they stand,

?? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ??????, ?????? ?? ??? ??????, ? In fact, if CD measures AB, CD is thus a common
?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ?????? ?????? ?????. ??? ???????, ??? measure of CD and AB, (since CD) also measures itself.

?? ?????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ??? ??, ? ?? ?? ??? left. But if not, AB and CD will be prime to one another

also measures the whole of BA. Thus, it will also measure the remainder AE. And AE measures DF. Thus, G
will also measure DF. And it also measures the whole
of DC. Thus, it will also measure the remainder CF,
the greater (measuring) the lesser. The very thing is impossible. Thus, some number which is greater than CF
cannot measure the numbers AB and CD. Thus, CF is
the greatest common measure of AB and CD. [(Which

??????? ??? ??? ??? ?, ? ?? ???????? ?????? ?????? ? For let the greatest common measure, D, of the two
?? ? ?? ? ??? ? ???? ?????? ? ?? ??????. ???????? ????????? (numbers) A and B have been taken [Prop. 7.2]. So D
?????? ?? ??? ???? ?, ?? ? ? ??? ???? ?, ?, ? ??????? ? either measures, or does not measure, C. First of all, let

197
STOIQEIWN zþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 7
????????. ?? ??? ?? ????? ? ? ??? ?, ?, ? ???????? ?????? measures A, B, and C. Thus, D is a common measure
??????, ???????? ??? ???? ?, ?, ? ???????? ??????? ?????? of A, B, and C. So I say that (it is) also the greatest
?? ??? ?. ????????, ??? ???? ? ?. ???? ??? ? ? ???? ?, ?, (common measure). For if D is not the greatest common
? ??????, ??? ???? ?, ? ??? ????????? ??? ?? ??? ?, ? ??? measure of A, B, and C then some number greater than
???????? ?????? ?????? ????????. ?? ?? ??? ?, ? ???????? D will measure the numbers A, B, and C. Let it (so)
?????? ?????? ????? ? ?? ? ? ??? ??? ? ?????? ? ?????? measure (A, B, and C), and let it be E. Therefore, since
??? ????????? ???? ????? ????????. ??? ??? ???? ?, ?, ? E measures A, B, and C, it will thus also measure A and
???????? ??????? ??? ???????? ?????? ?? ??? ?? ? ? ??? B. Thus, it will also measure the greatest common mea??? ?, ?, ? ???????? ???? ?????? ??????. sure of A and B [Prop. 7.2 corr.]. And D is the greatest
?? ???????? ?? ? ? ??? ?? ???? ??????, ??? ?? ?, ? common measure of A and B. Thus, E measures D, the

?? ???? ?, ?, ? ?????? ??? ???? ?, ? ????????, ??? ?? measure the numbers A, B, and C. Thus, D is the great??? ?, ? ???????? ?????? ?????? ??? ? ????????? ?????? est common measure of A, B, and C.
?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?, ? ??? ???????? ??????? ??? ????????? So let D not measure C. I say, first of all, that C
?? ?, ? ??? ??? ???? ?????? ???? ????????. ??????? ??? and D are not prime to one another. For since A, B, C
????? ?? ???????? ?????? ?????? ? ?. ??? ???? ? ? ??? ? are not prime to one another, some number will measure
??????, ? ?? ? ???? ?, ? ??????, ??? ? ? ??? ???? ?, ? them. So the (number) measuring A, B, and C will also
??????? ?????? ?? ??? ??? ?? ? ? ??? ???? ?, ?, ? ??????. measure A and B, and it will also measure the greatest
? ? ??? ??? ?, ?, ? ?????? ???? ??????. ???? ??, ??? ??? common measure, D, of A and B [Prop. 7.2 corr.]. And
????????. ?? ??? ?? ????? ? ? ??? ?, ?, ? ?? ???????? it also measures C. Thus, some number will measure the
?????? ??????, ???????? ??? ???? ?, ?, ? ???????? ??????? numbers D and C. Thus, D and C are not prime to one
?????? ?? ??? ?. ????????, ??? ???? ? ?. ??? ???? ? ? ???? another. Therefore, let their greatest common measure,
?, ?, ? ??????, ??? ???? ?, ? ??????? ??? ?? ??? ?, ? ??? E, have been taken [Prop. 7.2]. And since E measures
???????? ?????? ?????? ????????. ?? ?? ??? ?, ? ???????? D, and D measures A and B, E thus also measures A
?????? ?????? ????? ? ?? ? ? ??? ??? ? ??????? ?????? ?? and B. And it also measures C. Thus, E measures A, B,
??? ??? ?? ? ? ??? ???? ?, ? ??????? ??? ?? ??? ?, ? ??? and C. Thus, E is a common measure of A, B, and C. So
???????? ?????? ?????? ????????. ?? ?? ??? ?, ? ???????? I say that (it is) also the greatest (common measure). For
?????? ?????? ????? ? ?? ? ? ??? ??? ? ?????? ? ?????? if E is not the greatest common measure of A, B, and C
??? ????????? ???? ????? ????????. ??? ??? ???? ?, ?, ? then some number greater than E will measure the num???????? ??????? ??? ???????? ?????? ?? ??? ?? ? ? ??? bers A, B, and C. Let it (so) measure (A, B, and C), and
??? ?, ?, ? ???????? ???? ?????? ??????? ???? ???? ??????. let it be F. And since F measures A, B, and C, it also
measures A and B. Thus, it will also measure the greatest common measure of A and B [Prop. 7.2 corr.]. And
D is the greatest common measure of A and B. Thus, F
measures D. And it also measures C. Thus, F measures
D and C. Thus, it will also measure the greatest common measure of D and C [Prop. 7.2 corr.]. And E is the
greatest common measure of D and C. Thus, F measures
E, the greater (measuring) the lesser. The very thing is
impossible. Thus, some number which is greater than E
does not measure the numbers A, B, and C. Thus, E is
the greatest common measure of A, B, and C. (Which
is) the very thing it was required to show.

F are numbers called the same as the parts A, B, and C

(H) is less than G. The very thing is impossible. Thus,
there cannot be some number less than G which will have

??? ?. ??? ?? ??? ? ? ???? ??? ?, ????? ? ?? ? ???? (they are) also the least (sets of numbers continuously

?????????? ?? ?? ?? ??? ? ???? ??? ? ???? ??? ?? ?? ??? continuously proportional in the ratio of A to B, and of
? ???? ??? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ? ???? ??? ?. C to B, and, further, of E to F.
??????? ??? ? ??? ??? ?, ? ????????? ??????????? For let the least number, G, measured by (both) B and
??????? ? ?. ??? ?????? ??? ? ? ??? ? ??????, ?????????? C have be taken [Prop. 7.34]. And as many times as B
??? ? ? ??? ? ????????, ?????? ?? ? ? ??? ? ??????, ??- measures G, so many times let A also measure H. And as
???????? ??? ? ? ??? ? ????????. ? ?? ? ??? ? ???? ?????? many times as C measures G, so many times let D also

????? ? ? ???? ??? ?? ?? ?, ?, ?, ? ??? ???? ???????? Prop. 7.13]. And so, for the same (reasons), as C (is) to
????? ?? ?? ?? ??? ? ???? ??? ? ??? ?? ?? ??? ? ???? ??? D, so G (is) to K, and, further, as E (is) to F, so K (is)
? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ? ???? ??? ? ????. ???? ??, ??? ??? to L. Thus, H, G, K, L are continuously proportional in

?? ??? ? ???? ??? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ? ???? ??? ? ????. (both) measure O. Thus, the least number measured by
(both) B and C will also measure O [Prop. 7.35]. And
G (is) the least number measured by (both) B and C.
231
STOIQEIWN hþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 8
Thus, G measures O, the greater (measuring) the lesser.

G is the (number created) from (multiplying) L and M.

????? ?? ???? ??? ??????????? ???? ???? ??????. multiplying itself, and has made C (by) multiplying B, C
is thus cube. And since C, D, E, F are continuously proportional, and C is cube, F is thus also cube [Prop. 8.23].
And it was also shown (to be) square. Thus, the seventh
(number) from the unit is (both) cube and square. So,

in fact, (E) also does not measure (A). The very thing

another. Thus, (they are) composite (to one another).
And (numbers) composite (to one another) are (both)
measured by some [prime] number [Def. 7.14]. And
since E is assumed (to be) prime, and a prime (number)
is not measured by another number (other) than itself
[Def. 7.11], E thus measures (both) A and E. Hence, E
measures A. And it also measures D. Thus, E measures
(both) A and D. So, similarly, we can show that however
many prime numbers D is measured by, A will also be

A. And since G measures B according to H, G has thus
made B (by) multiplying H. But, in fact, A has also made
B (by) multiplying itself [Prop. 9.8]. Thus, the (number

on A. Thus, as H is to A, (so) A (is) to G [Prop. 7.19].
And A measures G. Thus, H also measures A, (despite

And since DE, EF are the least (of those numbers hav???? ???????? ?????? ?????? ??? ? ?? ??? ???? ???????? ing the same ratio as them), they are prime to one an??? ??, ?? ?????? ?????. ???? ??? ??? ? ?? ???? ??? other [Prop. 7.22]. And if two numbers are prime to
?? ?????? ?????? ?? ??, ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ?????? ?????. one another then the sum (of them) is also prime to each
??? ?? ??? ??????? ???? ???? ??????? ?????? ????, ??? ? [Prop. 7.28]. Thus, DF is also prime to each of DE, EF.
?? ????? ????????? ???? ??? ?????? ?????? ?????? ???? But, in fact, DE is also prime to EF. Thus, DF, DE

DE, EF plus twice the (number created) from (multiplying) DE, EF is equal to the (square) on DF [Prop. 2.4].
And thus the (sum of the squares) on DE, EF plus twice
the (rectangle contained) by DE, EF [is] prime to the
(rectangle contained) by DE, EF. By separation, the
(sum of the squares) on DE, EF plus once the (rectangle contained) by DE, EF is prime to the (rectangle
contained) by DE, EF.
† Again, by separation, the (sum
of the squares) on DE, EF is prime to the (rectangle

and the (rectangle contained) by DE, EF (is) B, and
the (square) on EF (is) C. Thus, A, C summed is prime

measures D according to E. Hence, A measures D. But,
it also does not measure (D). The very thing (is) absurd.
Thus, it is not possible to find a fourth number proportional to A, B, C when A does not measure D. And so
(let) A, B, C (be) neither continuously proportional, nor
(let) the outermost of them (be) prime to one another.
And let B make D (by) multiplying C. So, similarly, it
can be show that if A measures D then it is possible to
find a fourth (number) proportional to (A, B, C), and
impossible if (A) does not measure (D). (Which is) the
very thing it was required to show.
† The proof of this proposition is incorrect. There are, in fact, only two cases. Either A, B, C are continuously proportional, with A and C prime
to one another, or not. In the first case, it is impossible to find a fourth proportional number. In the second case, it is possible to find a fourth
proportional number provided that A measures B times C. Of the four cases considered by Euclid, the proof given in the second case is incorrect,
since it only demonstrates that if A : B :: C : D then a number E cannot be found such that B : C :: D : E. The proofs given in the other three

the (number created) from (multiplying) D, E is equal

the (number created) from (multiplying) Q, P is equal

as Q is to B, (so) L (is) to P [Prop. 7.19]. And Q is the
same as B. Thus, L is also the same as P. The very thing
(is) impossible. For P was assumed not (to be) the same
as any of the (numbers) set out. Thus, FG cannot be
measured by any number except A, B, C, D, E, HK, L,
M, and a unit. And FG was shown (to be) equal to (the
sum of) A, B, C, D, E, HK, L, M, and a unit. And a
perfect number is one which is equal to (the sum of) its
own parts [Def. 7.22]. Thus, FG is a perfect (number).
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

Likewise, the straight-lines are commensurable in length if ? : ? :: 1 : k, and incommensurable in length otherwise.
¶ To be more exact, straight-lines can either be commensurable in square only, incommensurable in length only, or commenusrable/incommensurable
in both length and square, with an assigned straight-line.
? Let the length of the assigned straight-line be unity. Then rational straight-lines have lengths expressible as k or k
1/2
, depending on whether
the lengths are commensurable in length, or in square only, respectively, with unity. All other straight-lines are irrational.
$ The square-root of an area is the length of the side of an equal area square.
k The area of the square on the assigned straight-line is unity. Rational areas are expressible as k. All other areas are irrational. Thus, squares
whose sides are of rational length have rational areas, and vice versa.

????? ?? ??????? ??? ?????? ???????? ?? ??, ??, Let AB and CD be the two given magnitudes, of

?????? ??????. the greatest common measure of AB and CD.
?? ?? ??? ??????? ???? ?????? ?? ?? ? ??. ?? ??? For the magnitude AB either measures, or (does) not

???????? ???? ?? ??? ?????? ??? ?? ?? ????? ????????? ?? So let AB not measure CD. And continually subtract??, ??? ??? ?? ??? ?? ?? ?? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ing in turn the lesser (magnitude) from the greater, the

the greater (measuring) the lesser. The very thing is impossible. Thus, some magnitude greater than AF cannot
measure (both) AB and CD. Thus, AF is the greatest

Thus, the greatest common measure of two given

STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10

?? ???????? ?? ?? ? ?? ?. ???? ??????, ??? ???????? A, B, C. Thus, D is a common measure of A, B, C. And
???? ?? ?, ?. ???? ??? ???????? ???? ?? ?, ?, ?, ???????? (it is) clear that (it is) also (the) greatest (common mea?? ???? ???????, ? ?????? ??? ?? ?, ? ????????? ???? sure). For no magnitude larger than D measures (both)

?????? ?? ??? ?? ?? ???? ?? ????????? ??????? ???????? ?? So let D not measure C. I say, first, that C and D are
?, ?? ???????? ??? ???? ?? ?, ?. ??????? ??? ????? ?? commensurable. For if A, B, C are commensurable then
???????? ?????? ??????, ??? ???? ?? ?. ???? ??? ?? ? ?? some magnitude will measure them which will clearly

?? ? ??? ??? ?, ?, ? ?????? ???? ??????. ???? ??, ??? ??? And it also measures C. Hence, the aforementioned mag????????. ?? ??? ???????, ???? ?? ??? ? ?????? ??????? nitude will measure (both) C and D. Thus, C and D are

??????, ??? ?? ?, ? ??? ???????? ??? ?? ??? ?, ? ???????? common measure have been taken [Prop. 10.3], and let

?? ?? ? ??? ?? ?, ? ??????? ??? ?? ??? ?, ? ??? ???????? it also measures C. Thus, E measures A, B, C. Thus, E
?????? ?????? ???????? ?? ?. ???? ?? ?? ?? ?? ? ??? ?? ? is a common measure of A, B, C. So I say that (it is) also
????????, ?? ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ????? ????????. ??? (the) greatest (common measure). For, if possible, let F

measures D. And it also measures C. Thus, F measures
(both) C and D. Thus, F will also measure the greatest
common measure of C and D [Prop. 10.3 corr.]. And it is
E. Thus, F will measure E, the greater (measuring) the
lesser. The very thing is impossible. Thus, some [magnitude] greater than the magnitude E cannot measure A,
B, C. Thus, if D does not measure C then E is the greatest common measure of A, B, C. And if it does measure

Thus, the greatest common measure of three given
commensurable magnitudes has been found. [(Which is)

?????? ??? ? ????? ??? ? ?????? ??????? ??? ?? ? ??????? Therefore, since C measures A according to the units
?? ?? ????? ??? ?? ?? ? ???? ?? ?, ????? ? ????? ???? in D, and a unit also measures D according to the units
??? ?? ???????? ???, ?? ?? ? ???? ?? ?, ????? ? ? ???? in it, a unit thus measures the number D as many times

???????, ?????? ??? ? ????? ??? ? ?????? ??? ?? ? ?? ?? to C, so D (is) to a unit [Prop. 5.7 corr.]. Again, since
????? ??? ?? ?? ? ???? ?? ?, ????? ? ????? ???? ??? ?. C measures B according to the units in E, and a unit
??????? ?? ??? ?? ?? ? ???? ?? ?, ? ? ???? ??? ??????? also measures E according to the units in it, a unit thus
??? ???? ??? ????? ?? ?? ? ???? ?? ?, ????? ? ? ??????? measures E the same number of times that C (measures)

?? ??? ???????? ?????? ?? ?, ? ???? ?????? ????? it was also shown that as A (is) to C, so D (is) to a unit.
????, ?? ??????? ? ? ???? ??????? ??? ?? ???? ???? ??????. Thus, via equality, as A is to B, so the number D (is) to
the (number) E [Prop. 5.22].
Thus, the commensurable magnitudes A and B have
to one another the ratio which the number D (has) to the

??? ? ?? ??? ? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ????????? ?????. Let A and BC be two unequal straight-lines, of which
(let) BC (be) the greater. And let a (rectangle) equal to
the fourth part of the (square) on the lesser, A—that is,
(equal) to the (square) on half of A—falling short by a
square figure, have been applied to BC. And let it be
the (rectangle contained) by BD and DC [see previous
lemma]. And let BD be commensurable in length with
DC. I say that that the square on BC is greater than
the (square on) A by (the square on some straight-line)
commensurable (in length) with (BC).

?????? ? ?? ???????? ??? ??? ??? ???? ?? ?, ??? ?? ????? Thus, the remainder DC is equal to BF. And since the
???? ?? ?, ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???????????? ?????????? straight-line BC has been cut into equal (pieces) at E,
???? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?????????? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??? and into unequal (pieces) at D, the rectangle contained
?? ?????????? ??? ?? ???????????? ?? ??? ???????? ??? by BD and DC, plus the square on ED, is thus equal to
??? ??, ?? ???? ??? ???????????? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? the square on EC [Prop. 2.5]. (The same) also (for) the
???? ?? ???????? ??? ??? ?? ?????????. ???? ?? ??? quadruples. Thus, four times the (rectangle contained)
??????????? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??? by BD and DC, plus the quadruple of the (square) on
? ??????????, ?? ?? ??????????? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? DE, is equal to four times the square on EC. But, the
???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??????????? ????????? ??? ????? ? ?? square on A is equal to the quadruple of the (rectangle

??? ??? ?? ??????????? ????????? ??? ???? ????? ? ?? equal to the quadruple of the (square) on DE. For DF

???? ????????? ?????? ??? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? ? ?? also be shown that BC is commensurable (in length)

?? ????????? ????? ? ?? ?????? ? ?? ??? ??? ? ?????? with DC, BC is thus also commensurable in length with
??????? ?? ??? ????????? ?????. CD [Prop. 10.15]. But, CD is commensurable in length
????? ?? ? ?? ??? ? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ????????? with CD plus BF. For CD is equal to BF [Prop. 10.6].
?????, ?? ?? ???????? ??? ??? ??? ? ???? ???? ??? ?? Thus, BC is also commensurable in length with BF plus
???????????? ???????? ????? ?????????, ??? ???? ?? ??? CD [Prop. 10.12]. Hence, BC is also commensurable

DC.
For, similarly, by the same construction, we can show
that the square on BC is greater than the (square on) A
by the (square) on FD. And the square on BC is greater
than the (square on) A by the (square) on (some straightline) commensurable (in length) with (BC). Thus, BC
is commensurable in length with FD. Hence, BC is
also commensurable in length with the remaining sum
of BF and DC [Prop. 10.15]. But, the sum of BF and
DC is commensurable [in length] with DC [Prop. 10.6].
Hence, BC is also commensurable in length with CD
[Prop. 10.12]. Thus, via separation, BD is also commensurable in length with DC [Prop. 10.15].
Thus, if there are two unequal straight-lines, and so

STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
???? ??? ????? ? ??? ?? ?? ??, ? ?? ?? ?? ??, ????? ??? GH is to NL, so FH (is) to KL [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, FH is

?? ??? ??? ?? ?????????. ??? ???? ?????????? ? ?? ??? plane (numbers), or square (numbers)—which are them??, ??, ????????? ???????, ???, ??? ??? ?????? ???????? selves also similar plane (numbers). Thus, the (num????????????????? ???????? ?????? ????, ? ????????? ber created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the

???????? ????? ? ??? ? ??? ?? ??? ??, ?? ???? ??? and BC, plus the square on CD, is equal to the square
??? [???] ?? ??????? ???? ??? ??? [???] ?? ??????????. on BD [see previous lemma]. Let the unit DE have

[???] ?? ??? ????? ??????????. from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the (square) on
?? ??? ????? ??????????, ???? ???? ???? ?? ??? [???] CE, is less than the square on BD. I say, therefore, that

??? ???????? ? ?? ?? ?. ? ??? ?? ??? ??, ?? ???? ??? from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the (square) on CE,
??? ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ?? ?????????. ???? ??? ? ?? be equal to the (square) on BE. And let GA be double
??? ??, ?? ???? ??? ??? ?? ???? ????????? ?? ??? [???] the unit DE. Therefore, since the whole of AC is double
?? ?????????? ? ??? ?? ??? ??, ?? ???? ??? ??? ?? the whole of CD, of which AG is double DE, the remain???? ???? ?? ?? ??? ??, ?? ???? ??? ??? ??. ??? ?????? der GC is thus double the remainder EC. Thus, GC has
???????????? ??? ??? ?? ????????? ? ?? ???? ?? ??? been cut in half at E. Thus, the (number created) from

?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??. ???? ??, ??? ???? ??????? ??? equal to the square on BE [Prop. 2.6]. But, the (num??? ??. ?? ??? ???????, ???? ?? ??? ?? ????, ??? ??? ber created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the
?? ????????? ? ??. ??? ???????????? ????? ????????? ? (square) on CE, was also assumed (to be) equal to the

be equal to the (square) on BF. And (let) HA (be) double DF. And it can again be inferred that HC (is) double
CF. Hence, CH has also been cut in half at F. And, on
account of this, the (number created) from (multiplying)
HB and BC, plus the (square) on FC, becomes equal to
the (square) on BF [Prop. 2.6]. And the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC, plus the (square)

HB and BC, plus the (square) on CF, will also be equal

the (number created) from (multiplying) AB and BC,

say that the (rectangle contained) by D and E is medial.
For since the (rectangle contained) by B and C is equal
to the (rectangle contained) by D and E, and the (rectangle contained) by B and C (is) medial [for B and C
are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in
square only] [Prop. 10.21], the (rectangle contained) by
D and E (is) thus also medial.
Thus, two medial (straight-lines), D and E, commensurable in square only, (and) containing a medial (area),
have been found such that the square on the greater is
larger than the (square on the) lesser by the (square) on
(some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with the

So, similarly, (the proposition) can again also be

AD and DB is equal to the (square) on AB [Prop. 1.47].
And the (rectangle contained) by AB and FD—that is to
say, the (rectangle contained) by AD and DB—is equal
to the (rectangle contained) by AB and BE. Thus, the
320
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
sum of the (squares) on AD and DB is incommensurable
with the (rectangle contained) by AD and DB.
Thus, two straight-lines, AD and DB, (which are) incommensurable in square, have been found, making the
sum of the (squares) on them medial, and the (rectangle
contained) by them medial, and, moreover, incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them.†

the (squares) on AB and BC—that is to say, the (square)
on AC [Prop. 2.4]—is incommensurable with the sum of
the (squares) on AB and BC [Prop. 10.16]. And the sum
of the (squares) on AB and BC (is) rational. Thus, the

is also irrational [Def. 10.4]—let it be called a binomial
(straight-line).‡
(Which is) the very thing it was required

But, EH is equal to (the sum of) the squares on AB and
BC, and HF is equal to twice the (rectangle) contained
by AB and BC. Thus, EH is incommensurable with
HF. Hence, DH is also incommensurable in length with
HG [Props. 6.1, 10.11]. Thus, DH and HG are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square
only. Hence, DG is irrational [Prop. 10.36]. And DE (is)
rational. And the rectangle contained by irrational and
rational (straight-lines) is irrational [Prop. 10.20]. The
area DF is thus irrational, and (so) the square-root [of
it] is irrational [Def. 10.4]. And AC is the square-root
of DF. AC is thus irrational—let it be called a second
bimedial (straight-line).§
(Which is) the very thing it was

???? ?? ?? ????????? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ??? We will now demonstrate that the aforementioned
???????, ?? ?? ?????????? ???????? ?? ?????????? ????, irrational (straight-lines) are uniquely divided into the
???????? ??? ???????????? ????????? ????????? straight-lines of which they are the sum, and which produce the prescribed types, (after) setting forth the following lemma.
? ? ? ? ? A D E B C
????????? ?????? ? ?? ??? ???????? ? ??? ??? ????? Let the straight-line AB be laid out, and let the whole

??? ????, ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??????? ???? ??? ??? of the (points) C and D. And let AC be assumed (to be)

???????? ??? ? ?? ???? ???? ?? ?. ??? ???? ?????? AC and CB is greater than (the sum of) the (squares) on
????? ? ?? ??? ??, ????? ???????? ? ??? ????? ??? ? ?? AD and DB.
?????? ??? ?? ?????? ?????. ??? ?? ? ?? ?? ??? ??????? For let AB have been cut in half at E. And since AC is
??? ? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?, ? ??? ?????? ??? ???? ???????? greater than DB, let DC have been subtracted from both.
??? ??????????. ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ??? ??? Thus, the remainder AD is greater than the remainder
??? ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ???? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? CB. And AE (is) equal to EB. Thus, DE (is) less than
??, ?? ???? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? EC. Thus, points C and D are not equally far from the
??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???? ?? point of bisection. And since the (rectangle contained)
??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? by AC and CB, plus the (square) on EC, is equal to the
?? ??????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ?? ??? (square) on EB [Prop. 2.5], but, moreover, the (rectan??? ??, ?? ??????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??, ??. ???? ??? gle contained) by AD and DB, plus the (square) on DE,
?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??, is also equal to the (square) on EB [Prop. 2.5], the (rect??. ??? ?????? ??? ?? ??????????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, angle contained) by AC and CB, plus the (square) on
?? ?????? ???? ??? ??????????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ??. EC, is thus equal to the (rectangle contained) by AD and

on DE is less than the (square) on EC. And, thus, the
326
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
remaining (rectangle contained) by AC and CB is less
than the (rectangle contained) by AD and DB. And,
hence, twice the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB
is less than twice the (rectangle contained) by AD and
DB. And thus the remaining sum of the (squares) on AC
and CB is greater than the sum of the (squares) on AD
and DB.

(Which is) the very thing it was required to

??, ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ??? ????? ? ????. ?? ??? ???????, For, if possible, let it also have been divided at D, such
????. ????? ?? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ? ????? ??? ????? ?? ? ?? that AD and DB are also rational (straight-lines which
???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ??? ????? ? ?? are) commensurable in square only. So, (it is) clear that
???? ?? ???? ?? ???? ?? ? ????????? ??????????? ??? ???? AC is not the same as DB. For, if possible, let it be (the
?? ?? ???? ??? ?????????. ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ????? ? same). So, AD will also be the same as CB. And as
????. ??? ?? ????? ??? ?? ?, ? ?????? ??? ???? ???????? AC will be to CB, so BD (will be) to DA. And AB will
??? ??????????. ? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??? (thus) also be divided at D in the same (manner) as the
??? ??? ??, ??, ????? ???????? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, division at C. The very opposite was assumed. Thus, AC
?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, is not the same as DB. So, on account of this, points
?? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? C and D are not equally far from the point of bisection.
???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ??. Thus, by whatever (amount the sum of) the (squares) on

the (squares) on AD and DB, plus twice the (rectangle

on AB [Prop. 2.4]. But, (the sum of) the (squares) on AC
and CB differs from (the sum of) the (squares) on AD
and DB by a rational (area). For (they are) both rational
(areas). Thus, twice the (rectangle contained) by AD
and DB also differs from twice the (rectangle contained)

the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB. Thus, EG is
incommensurable with HK. Hence, EH is also incom329
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
mensurable in length with HN [Props. 6.1, 10.11]. And
(they are) rational (straight-lines). Thus, EH and HN
are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in
square only. And if two rational (straight-lines which
are) commensurable in square only are added together
then the whole (straight-line) is that irrational called binomial [Prop. 10.36]. Thus, EN is a binomial (straightline) which has been divided (into its component terms)
at H. So, according to the same (reasoning), EM and
MN can be shown (to be) rational (straight-lines which
are) commensurable in square only. And EN will (thus)
be a binomial (straight-line) which has been divided (into
its component terms) at the different (points) H and M
(which is absurd [Prop. 10.42]). And EH is not the same
as MN, since (the sum of) the (squares) on AC and CB
is greater than (the sum of) the (squares) on AD and
DB. But, (the sum of) the (squares) on AD and DB is
greater than twice the (rectangle contained) by AD and

on AC and CB—that is to say, EG—is also much greater
than twice the (rectangle contained) by AD and DB—
that is to say, MK. Hence, EH is also greater than MN
[Prop. 6.1]. Thus, EH is not the same as MN. (Which

(some) square number (has) to (some) square number
either. Thus, EF is incommensurable in length with FG
[Prop 10.9]. EF and FG are thus rational (straight-lines

????? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?????? ?? ? ?? (has) to (some) square number either. Thus, EF is in??? ??, ?????? ??? [???] ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??. commensurable in length with FG [Prop. 10.9]. EF and
???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???????????? FG are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commen??? ????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ?? ??? ??? ?? surable in square only. Thus, EG is a binomial (straight???? ?? ??? ??? ?. ???? ? ?? ???? ??? ?? ????? ????, ?? line) [Prop. 10.36]. So, we must show that (it is) also a
?????????? ??????? ???? ?????????? ???????? ??? ?? ??? second (binomial straight-line).
??? ?? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ? ????? ????, ?? ?????????? For since, inversely, as the number BA is to AC, so
??????? ???? ?????????? ???????. ????????? ??? ????? ? the (square) on GF (is) to the (square) on FE [Prop. 5.7

?????????, ??? ?? ?? ??????? ????? ?? ????????? ???? [Prop. 5.14]. Let (the sum of) the (squares) on EF and

the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some)
square number. Thus, the (square) on FG also has to
the (square) on H the ratio which (some) square number
(has) to (some) square number. Thus, FG is commensurable in length with H [Prop. 10.9]. Hence, the square on
FG is greater than (the square on) FE by the (square) on
(some straight-line) commensurable in length with (FG).
And FG and FE are rational (straight-lines which are)
commensurable in square only. And the lesser term EF
is commensurable in length with the rational (straightline) D (previously) laid down.
Thus, EG is a second binomial (straight-line) [Def.

STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10

(is) thus greater than the (square) on GH [Prop. 5.14].
Therefore, let (the sum of) the (squares) on GH and
K be equal to the (square) on FG. Thus, via conversion, as AB [is] to BC, so the (square) on FG (is)
to the (square) on K [Prop. 5.19 corr.]. And AB has
to BC the ratio which (some) square number (has) to
(some) square number. Thus, the (square) on FG also
has to the (square) on K the ratio which (some) square
number (has) to (some) square number. Thus, FG [is]
commensurable in length with K [Prop. 10.9]. Thus,
the square on FG is greater than (the square on) GH
by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable
(in length) with (FG). And FG and GH are rational
(straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only,
and neither of them is commensurable in length with E.
Thus, FH is a third binomial (straight-line) [Def.

?????? ??? ?? ?? ?????????? ??? ????? ??? ?? ??? For let the area AC be contained by the rational
??? ?? ??? ???????? ?????? ??? ??? ????, ??? ? ?? (straight-line) AB and by the first binomial (straight?? ?????? ???????? ?????? ????? ? ????????? ?? ??? line) AD. I say that square-root of area AC is the ir????????. rational (straight-line which is) called binomial.
????? ??? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ????? ? ??, ???????? For since AD is a first binomial (straight-line), let it
??? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ?, ??? ???? ?? ?????? ????? have been divided into its (component) terms at E, and
?? ??. ??????? ??, ??? ?? ??, ?? ????? ???? ??????? let AE be the greater term. So, (it is) clear that AE and
????? ?????????, ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ED are rational (straight-lines which are) commensu????????? ?????, ??? ? ?? ????????? ???? ?? ????????? rable in square only, and that the square on AE is greater
???? ?? ?? ?????. ???????? ?? ? ?? ???? ???? ?? ? than (the square on) ED by the (square) on (some
???????. ??? ???? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (AE), and
????????? ?????, ??? ??? ?? ??????? ????? ??? ??? ??? that AE is commensurable (in length) with the rational
?????????, ???????? ?? ??? ??? ??, ???? ???? ??? ??????? (straight-line) AB (first) laid out [Def. 10.5]. So, let ED
??? ?? ????????? ???????? ????? ?????????, ??? ???????? have been cut in half at point F. And since the square on
????? ???????. ???????????? ??? ???? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? AE is greater than (the square on) ED by the (square)
?? ???? ?? ??? ??, ??? ????????? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with
?? ?????. ??? ??????? ??? ??? ?, ?, ? ??????? ??? ??, (AE), thus if a (rectangle) equal to the fourth part of the
?? ?????????? ?? ??, ??, ??? ??? ?? ??? ?? ???????- (square) on the lesser (term)—that is to say, the (square)
???????? ???? ?????????? ????????? ?? ??, ?? ?? ?? on EF—falling short by a square figure, is applied to the
???? ?? ??, ??? ?????? ???? ??? ??????? ????? ??? ?? greater (term) AE, then it divides it into (terms which
?? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ???? ??? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? ???- are) commensurable (in length) [Prop 10.17]. Therefore,
?????????? ?? ?? ????????????????? ?????????? ??? let the (rectangle contained) by AG and GE, equal to the
???? ?? ??. ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? (square) on EF, have been applied to AE. AG is thus
??? ??, ????? ??? ?? ? ?? ???? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? commensurable in length with EG. And let GH, EK,
??? ??? ?? ??? ?? ?? ???? ??, ?? ?? ???? ??? ??? and FL have been drawn from (points) G, E, and F (re??, ?? ??? ????? ???????? ???? ?? ??. ???? ?? ??? ?? spectively), parallel to either of AB or CD. And let the
???? ???? ?? ??, ?? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??? square SN, equal to the parallelogram AH, have been
????? ???????? ???? ?? ??. ???? ?? ??? ????? ??? ??, constructed, and (the square) NQ, equal to (the parallel?? ????? ???????? ??? ?? ??? ???? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?? ogram) GK [Prop. 2.14]. And let MN be laid down so
??? ???? ??? ?? ?? ???? ?????. ???? ?? ??? ?? ??, ?? as to be straight-on to NO. RN is thus also straight-on
???? ??, ?? ???? ???? ??? ?? ?? ???? ????? ??? ?? ??, to NP. And let the parallelogram SQ have been com???????? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?????????? ?? ?? ??? ??????? ? pleted. SQ is thus a square [Prop. 10.53 lem.]. And since
??. ????, ??? ? ?? ?? ??? ???????? ?????. the (rectangle contained) by AG and GE is equal to the
????? ??? ????????? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ????????? ???? (square) on EF, thus as AG is to EF, so FE (is) to EG
??? ? ?? ??????? ??? ??, ??. ????????? ?? ??? ? ?? ?? [Prop. 6.17]. And thus as AH (is) to EL, (so) EL (is)
342
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
?? ?????????? ??? ?? ??, ?? ??? ?? ?? ????????? ?????. to KG [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, EL is the mean proportional to
??? ???? ???? ? ??? ???? ??? ???? ??? ??????? ??? ??, ??? AH and GK. But, AH is equal to SN, and GK (is) equal
????? ??? ????? ???????? ??? ??, ??, ??? ???? ????????? to NQ. EL is thus the mean proportional to SN and NQ.
?? ?? ?? ??. ???? ?? ??? ?? ?? ?? ???? ?????, ?? ?? And MR is also the mean proportional to the same—
?? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??, ?? ???, ???????? ?? ??? ??? ??, (namely), SN and NQ [Prop. 10.53 lem.]. EL is thus
??, ???? ???? ??? ????????. ??? ???? ?????????? ????? ? equal to MR. Hence, it is also equal to PO [Prop. 1.43].
?? ?? ?? ?????, ???? ? ??? ?? ?? ?? ???? ?????????, And AH plus GK is equal to SN plus NQ. Thus, the
? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?????????, ?????????? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? whole of AC is equal to the whole of SQ—that is to say,
??? ???? ??? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?????????? ?????. ???? ?? ??? to the square on MO. Thus, MO (is) the square-root of
?? ?? ?? ????? ????, ?? ?? ?? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? (area) AC. I say that MO is a binomial (straight-line).
?? ?? ?????????? ?????. ???? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??, ? ?? For since AG is commensurable (in length) with GE,
???? ??? ??? ?????????? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? ?? ? AE is also commensurable (in length) with each of AG
??? ?? ?? ??, ? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?????????? ??? ????? ? and GE [Prop. 10.15]. And AE was also assumed (to
?? ?? ??. ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ????????? ?? ??? ??? be) commensurable (in length) with AB. Thus, AG
??, ??? ????? ????????? ?? ??, ?? ??? ????? ???? ??????? and GE are also commensurable (in length) with AB
????? ?????????. [Prop. 10.12]. And AB is rational. AG and GE are
?? ?? ??? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ??? ??????? ?? ??? thus each also rational. Thus, AH and GK are each
???? ???? ??????. rational (areas), and AH is commensurable with GK
[Prop. 10.19]. But, AH is equal to SN, and GK to NQ.
SN and NQ—that is to say, the (squares) on MN and
NO (respectively)—are thus also rational and commensurable. And since AE is incommensurable in length
with ED, but AE is commensurable (in length) with
AG, and DE (is) commensurable (in length) with EF,
AG (is) thus also incommensurable (in length) with EF
[Prop. 10.13]. Hence, AH is also incommensurable with
EL [Props. 6.1, 10.11]. But, AH is equal to SN, and
EL to MR. Thus, SN is also incommensurable with
MR. But, as SN (is) to MR, (so) PN (is) to NR
[Prop. 6.1]. PN is thus incommensurable (in length)
with NR [Prop. 10.11]. And PN (is) equal to MN, and
NR to NO. Thus, MN is incommensurable (in length)
with NO. And the (square) on MN is commensurable
with the (square) on NO, and each (is) rational. MN
and NO are thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
Thus, MO is (both) a binomial (straight-line) [Prop.
10.36], and the square-root of AC. (Which is) the very
thing it was required to show.

If the rational straight-line has unit length then this proposition states that the square-root of a first binomial straight-line is a binomial straightline: i.e., a first binomial straight-line has a length k + k

?????????? ??? ?????? ?? ???? ??? ????? ??? ?? For let the area ABCD be contained by the rational

???????? ??? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ?, ???? ?? ?????? For since AD is a second binomial (straight-line), let it

?? ? ?? ?? ??, ?????????? ??? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? ???? as to be straight-on to NO. Thus, RN [is] also straight-on
????????? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ????????? ???? ??? ? ?? to NP. And let the square SQ have been completed. So,
??????? ??? ??, ??. ???? ? ?? ?????????? ?? ?? ?????? (it is) clear from what has been previously demonstrated
??? ?? ??, ?? ??? ?????????? ???? ?? ??. ?? ??, ??, [Prop. 10.53 lem.] that MR is the mean proportional to

????? ???????? ??? ??, ??. ???? ??? ???????? ??? ??, square-root of the area AC. So, we must show that MO
?? ????? ?????. ??? ?? ??, ?? ??? ????? ?????. ??? is a first bimedial (straight-line).
???? ????????? ? ?? ?? ?? ?????, ????????? ???? ??? Since AE is incommensurable in length with ED,

?????????, ?????????? ??? ? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? with each of AG and GE [Prop. 10.15]. But, AE is in?? ?? ?? ?????????? ?????, ???????? ?? ?? ?? ??, commensurable in length with AB. Thus, AG and GE

?????. the (square) on MN with the (square) on NO [hence,

10.11]. And since AE is incommensurable in length with
ED, but AE is commensurable (in length) with AG, and
ED commensurable (in length) with EF, AG (is) thus
incommensurable (in length) with EF [Prop. 10.13].
Hence, AH is also incommensurable with EL—that is
to say, SN with MR—that is to say, PN with NR—that
is to say, MN is incommensurable in length with NO
[Props. 6.1, 10.11]. But MN and NO have also been
shown to be medial (straight-lines) which are commensurable in square. Thus, MN and NO are medial (straightlines which are) commensurable in square only. So, I say
that they also contain a rational (area). For since DE was
assumed (to be) commensurable (in length) with each of
AB and EF, EF (is) thus also commensurable with EK
[Prop. 10.12]. And they (are) each rational. Thus, EL—
that is to say, MR—(is) rational [Prop. 10.19]. And MR
is the (rectangle contained) by MNO. And if two medial
(straight-lines), commensurable in square only, which
contain a rational (area), are added together, then the
whole is (that) irrational (straight-line which is) called
first bimedial [Prop. 10.37].
Thus, MO is a first bimedial (straight-line). (Which
is) the very thing it was required to show.
†
If the rational straight-line has unit length then this proposition states that the square-root of a second binomial straight-line is a first bimedial
straight-line: i.e., a second binomial straight-line has a length k/?

EL—that is to say, MR—[is] thus medial [Prop. 10.21].

???? ??? ???????? ????????? ???? ??? ?? ??????????? ?? each equal to once the (rectangle contained) by ACB.
??? ??? ??? ??, ??. ??? ????? ???? ?? ??? ????? ??? And since AB is a binomial (straight-line), having been
???? ?? ??. ??? ???? ????? ??? ?? ??????????? ???? ??? divided into its (component) terms at C, AC and CB are
????? ? ?? ??? ????????? ?? ?? ?????. ?????, ???? ?? ??, thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable
?? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ?????????, ????? ??? ???? in square only [Prop. 10.36]. Thus, the (squares) on AC
?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ??, ???????? ?? ??. ??? ???? ????? and CB are rational, and commensurable with one an??? ?? ??????????? ???? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? ?????????? other. And hence the sum of the (squares) on AC and

??? ?? ?? ????? ?????????? ?????????? ??? ????? ? ?? DL is rational. And it is applied to the rational (straight?? ?? ?????. ??? ???? ?????? ?? ??, ?? ??? ????? ???? line) DE. DM is thus rational, and commensurable in

????? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????? ???????? ???? ?? square only, twice the (rectangle contained) by AC and
??? ??? ???, ??? ??? ??, ?? ??? ????? ???????? ???? CB—that is to say, MF—is thus medial [Prop. 10.21].

??. ??? ???? ????????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? MD is also rational, and commensurable in length with
??, ????????? ???? ??? ?? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??? ? ?? DE. Thus, DM is incommensurable in length with MG
?? ?? ????????? ?????. ??? ???? ??????? ???? ?? ??? ??? [Prop. 10.13]. And they are rational. DM and MG are
??, ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??, ??, ?????? ??? ??? ?? ?? thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable
??? ??? ???? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ?????. ??? ????? in square only. Thus, DG is a binomial (straight-line)
???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ?? ??? ??? ??, ???????? ?? [Prop. 10.36]. So, we must show that (it is) also a first
??????? ??? ??? ??? ??, ??? ????????? ? ?? ?? ??. (binomial straight-line).
??? ?? ??? ??? ??????? ??????, ?? ?? ??????? ????? ??? ??? Since the (rectangle contained) by ACB is the
??? ????????? ???? ???? ??? ??????? ????????? ???????? mean proportional to the squares on AC and CB
????? ????????? ??? ??? ???????? ????? ??????, ? ?????? [Prop. 10.53 lem.], MO is thus also the mean propor??? ????????? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ????????? ?????? ? tional to DH and KL. Thus, as DH is to MO, so
?? ??? ??? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ????????? ?????. MO (is) to KL—that is to say, as DK (is) to MN,
??? ???? ????? ?? ??, ??, ??? ? ?? ?????? ????? ???? (so) MN (is) to MK [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, the (rectan????????? ???? ?? ????????? ???? ?? ?? ?????. gle contained) by DK and KM is equal to the (square)
?? ?? ??? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ?????? ???? ???? on MN [Prop. 6.17]. And since the (square) on AC is
??????. commensurable with the (square) on CB, DH is also
commensurable with KL. Hence, DK is also commensurable with KM [Props. 6.1, 10.11]. And since (the sum
of) the squares on AC and CB is greater than twice the
(rectangle contained) by AC and CB [Prop. 10.59 lem.],
DL (is) thus also greater than MF. Hence, DM is also
greater than MG [Props. 6.1, 5.14]. And the (rectangle contained) by DK and KM is equal to the (square)
on MN—that is to say, to one quarter the (square) on
MG. And DK (is) commensurable (in length) with KM.
And if there are two unequal straight-lines, and a (rectangle) equal to the fourth part of the (square) on the
lesser, falling short by a square figure, is applied to the
greater, and divides it into (parts which are) commensurable (in length), then the square on the greater is larger
351
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
than (the square on) the lesser by the (square) on (some
straight-line) commensurable (in length) with the greater
[Prop. 10.17]. Thus, the square on DM is greater than
(the square on) MG by the (square) on (some straightline) commensurable (in length) with (DM). And DM
and MG are rational. And DM, which is the greater
term, is commensurable in length with the (previously)
laid down rational (straight-line) DE.
Thus, DG is a first binomial (straight-line) [Def.
10.5]. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

For since (the sum of) the squares on AC and CB is

Hence, DM (is) also (greater) than MG [Prop. 6.1].
And since the (square) on AC is commensurable with
the (square) on CB, DH is also commensurable with
KL. Hence, DK is also commensurable (in length) with
KM [Props. 6.1, 10.11]. And the (rectangle contained)

square on DM is greater than (the square on) MG by

they are rational. DG is thus a binomial (straight-line)
[Prop. 10.36]. [So] we must show that (it is) also a third

So, similarly to the previous (propositions), we can
conclude that DM is greater than MG, and DK (is) commensurable (in length) with KM. And the (rectangle

Thus, the square on DM is greater than (the square on)
MG by the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in length) with (DM) [Prop. 10.17]. And neither

??? ??? ??, ?????????? ??? ???? ??? ?? ?? ?? ??? thus rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable
???? ?????????? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ?????. ??? ?? ??? in square only. Thus, DG is a binomial (straight-line)
??? ??????? ??????, ?? ?? ??????? ????? ??? ??? ??? [Prop. 10.36]. [So] we must show that (it is) also a fourth
????????? ???? ???????????????? ???? ??? ??????? ????- (binomial straight-line).
????? ???????? ????? ????????? ??? ??? ????????? ????? So, similarly to the previous (propositions), we can
??????, ? ?????? ??? ????????? ?????? ????????? ?? ??? show that DM is greater than MG, and that the (rectan?????????? ????? ?????? ? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?????? ??????? gle contained) by DKM is equal to the (square) on MN.
?? ??? ?????????? ?????. ??? ????? ?? ??, ?? ????? Therefore, since the (square) on AC is incommensurable

?? ?? ??? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ???????? ???? ???? KM [Props. 6.1, 10.11]. And if there are two unequal

part of the (square) on the lesser, falling short by a square
figure, is applied to the greater, and divides it into (parts
which are) incommensurable (in length), then the square
on the greater will be larger than (the square on) the
lesser by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable in length with the greater [Prop. 10.18]. Thus,
the square on DM is greater than (the square on) MG
by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable
(in length) with (DM). And DM and MG are rational
(straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
And DM is commensurable (in length) with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) DE.
Thus, DG is a fourth binomial (straight-line) [Def.
10.8]. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

In other words, the square of a major is a fourth binomial. See Prop. 10.57.

???????????? ?? ???? ???? ??? ??????. ???? ??? Let the same construction be made as in the (proposi????? ??? ????? ???????? ????? ? ?? ????????? ???? ?? tions) before this. Therefore, since AB is the square-root

??????????? ?? ??? ??? ????? ?????????? ?????, ?? ?? ??? at C, AC and CB are thus incommensurable in square,

? ?? ??? ????? ?????????? ?? ??. ?????, ???? ????? ???? Therefore, since the sum of the (squares) on AC and

????????? ?? ??. ?????????? ??? ? ?? ?? ??? ?? ??, and incommensurable in length with DE [Prop. 10.22].
?? ??? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ?????????? ?? ??? ??? Again, since twice the (rectangle contained) by ACB—

??????? ??? ???????????, ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ???? and commensurable (in length) with DE [Prop. 10.20].
???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ??? ?????????? ? ?? ?? ?? ?????? ? DM (is) thus incommensurable (in length) with MG

??????. For, similarly (to the previous propositions), it can
be shown that the (rectangle contained) by DKM is
equal to the (square) on MN, and DK (is) incommensurable in length with KM. Thus, the square on DM
is greater than (the square on) MG by the (square) on
(some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with
(DM) [Prop. 10.18]. And DM and MG are [rational]
(straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only,
and the lesser MG is commensurable in length with DE.
Thus, DG is a fifth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.9].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

???????????? ??? ?? ???? ???? ????????. ??? ???? ? For let the same construction be made as in the pre?? ??? ???? ???????? ???? ????????? ???? ?? ?, ?? ??, ?? vious (propositions). And since AB is the square-root

????? ????? ???????? ??? ??, ??. ??? ???? ????? ??? the sum of the squares on them incommensurable with

?????????? ?? ?? ?????. ??? ???? ?????????? ???? ?? according to what has been previously demonstrated, DL
??????????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, and MF are each medial. And they are applied to the

?????????? ?? ??? ??? ???????? ????? ? ??. ???? ??, ??? [Prop. 10.22]. And since the sum of the (squares) on

?? ?? ??? ?? ??? ???????? ????? ????? ???? ???? [Prop. 10.36]. So, I say that (it is) also a sixth (binomial
??????. straight-line).
So, similarly (to the previous propositions), we can
again show that the (rectangle contained) by DKM is
equal to the (square) on MN, and that DK is incommensurable in length with KM. And so, for the same
(reasons), the square on DM is greater than (the square
on) MG by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable in length with (DM) [Prop. 10.18]. And neither of DM and MG is commensurable in length with the
(previously) laid down rational (straight-line) DE.
Thus, DG is a sixth binomial (straight-line) [Def.

??????. And the (squares) on AE and EB (added) together are

(are) thus also rational. So, similarly, twice the (rectangle contained) by AE and EB is also commensurable
with twice the (rectangle contained) by CF and FD. And
twice the (rectangle contained) by AE and EB is medial. Therefore, twice the (rectangle contained) by CF
and FD (is) also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.]. CF and FD
are thus (straight-lines which are) incommensurable in
square [Prop 10.13], simultaneously making the sum of
the squares on them rational, and twice the (rectangle

CF and FD (is) medial, and, moreover, the sum of the
squares on CF and FD (is) incommensurable with the

??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ?? ?? ?? ??, ?????? ??? ??? ?? ?? in length with HK [Prop. 10.11]. And they are both ra??? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ??. ???? ??? ? ?? tional. Thus, EH and HK are rational (straight-lines

????? ?? ???? ??????? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?? [Def. 10.5]. And EF (is) rational. And if an area is con??? ??????? ???? ??? ??? ???? ??? ? ?? ??????? ???? tained by a rational (straight-line) and a first binomial

?????????? ??? ????? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???????? ????????, ? by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable

?? ???????? ?? ??? ????? ???? ?????. ???? ?? ? ?? ??? (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) EF. Thus,
?? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????????? ?????. ??? ????? EK is a fourth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.8]. And
? ??????? ? ?? ????????? ?? ????????? ???? ?? ??? ? EF (is) rational. And if an area is contained by a rational

?? ?????? ?????????? ??? ????? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???????? the square-root of the area is the irrational (straight-line)
???????, ? ?? ?????? ???????? ????? ??? ????? ???????? called major [Prop. 10.57]. Thus, the square-root of area

??? ????? ???????? ?????. And so, let AB be less than CD. Thus, EG is also less
?????? ??? ??? ????? ???????????? ???????? ?????? than HI. Hence, EH is also less than HK [Props. 6.1,
????????? ???? ?? ??? ???????? ? ?? ??? ????? ????? ? 5.14]. And the square on HK is greater than (the

(square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in
length) with (HK). Let it, first of all, be greater by the
square on (some straight-line) commensurable in length
with (HK). And the lesser (of the two components of
EK) EH is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) EF. Thus, EK
is a second binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.6]. And EF
(is) rational. And if an area is contained by a rational
(straight-line) and a second binomial (straight-line) then
the square-root of the area is a first bimedial (straightline) [Prop. 10.55]. Thus, the square-root of area EI is
a first bimedial (straight-line). Hence, the square-root of
AD is also a first bimedial (straight-line). And so, let
the square on HK be greater than (the square on) HE
by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable
(in length) with (HK). And the lesser (of the two components of EK) EH is commensurable (in length) with the
(previously) laid down rational (straight-line) EF. Thus,
EK is a fifth binomial (straight-line) [Def. 10.9]. And
EF (is) rational. And if an area is contained by a rational (straight-line) and a fifth binomial (straight-line) then
the square-root of the area is the square-root of a rational
plus a medial (area) [Prop. 10.58]. Thus, the square-root
of area EI is the square-root of a rational plus a medial
(area). Hence, the square-root of area AD is also the
364
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
square-root of a rational plus a medial (area).
Thus, when a rational and a medial area are added together, four irrational (straight-lines) arise (as the squareroots of the total area)—either a binomial, or a first bimedial, or a major, or the square-root of a rational plus a
medial (area). (Which is) the very thing it was required

A binomial (straight-line), and the (other) irrational
(straight-lines) after it, are neither the same as a medial
(straight-line) nor (the same) as one another. For the
(square) on a medial (straight-line), applied to a rational
(straight-line), produces as breadth a rational (straightline which is) also incommensurable in length with (the
straight-line) to which it is applied [Prop. 10.22]. And
the (square) on a binomial (straight-line), applied to a
rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a first binomial [Prop. 10.60]. And the (square) on a first bimedial
(straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a second binomial [Prop. 10.61]. And
the (square) on a second bimedial (straight-line), applied
to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a third
binomial [Prop. 10.62]. And the (square) on a major
(straight-line), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth a fourth binomial [Prop. 10.63]. And
the (square) on the square-root of a rational plus a medial
366
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
(area), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as
breadth a fifth binomial [Prop. 10.64]. And the (square)
on the square-root of (the sum of) two medial (areas),
applied to a rational (straight-line), produces as breadth
a sixth binomial [Prop. 10.65]. And the aforementioned
breadths differ from the first (breadth), and from one
another—from the first, because it is rational—and from
one another, because they are not the same in order.
Hence, the (previously mentioned) irrational (straightlines) themselves also differ from one another.

374
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
??? ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ?? ??? ?????????? ?? ?? ?????. square-root of EL. So, again, let EI, equal to the (sum

??? ??, ?? ????? ?????. ??? ????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? producing EN as breadth. And EL is also equal to the

?????? ??? ??? ???? ??? ???? ??? ? ?? ??? ?????????? the (rectangle contained) by AD and DB [Prop. 2.7].
?? ?? ?????. ??? ???? ?? ??, ?? ??????? ????? ????????? And since AC and CB are (both) medial (straight-lines),
?????, ?????????? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ?? ?????. ?? ?? ? ?? the (sum of the squares) on AC and CB is also me???? ??? ??, ????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? dial. And it is equal to EG. Thus, EG is also medial

??? ??, ??, ?? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????????? ???? ?? EM is rational, and incommensurable in length with EF
??? ??? ??? ??, ??? ????????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, [Prop. 10.22]. Again, since the (rectangle contained) by
?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ??. ??? ???? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??, AC and CB is medial, twice the (rectangle contained)
?? ???? ?? ??, ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ?? ??? by AC and CB is also medial [Prop. 10.23 corr.]. And it

? ?? ?? ?? ?????. ??? ????? ????????? ?????? ?? ??, ?? as breadth. Thus, HM is also rational, and incommen??? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ????? surable in length with EF [Prop. 10.22]. And since AC
? ??, ????????????? ?? ???? ? ??. ?????? ?? ????????, and CB are commensurable in square only, AC is thus

?? ??? ????? ??????? ??????? ??? ????? ??????????? (square) on AC is incommensurable with the (rectan?????? ???? ??????? ????? ????????? ???? ?? ???, ???? gle contained) by AC and CB [Prop. 10.11]. But, the

with the (square) on AC, and twice the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB is commensurable with the (rectangle contained) by AC and CB [Prop. 10.6]. Thus,
the (sum of the squares) on AC and CB is incommensurable with twice the (rectangle contained) by AC and
CB [Prop. 10.13]. And EG is equal to the (sum of the
squares) on AC and CB. And GH is equal to twice the
(rectangle contained) by AC and CB. Thus, EG is incommensurable with HG. And as EG (is) to HG, so EM
is to HM [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, EM is incommensurable
in length with MH [Prop. 10.11]. And they are both
rational (straight-lines). Thus, EM and MH are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square
only. Thus, EH is an apotome [Prop. 10.73], and HM
(is) attached to it. So, similarly, we can show that HN
(is) also (commensurable in square only with EN and is)
attached to (EH). Thus, different straight-lines, which
are commensurable in square only with the whole, are
attached to an apotome. The very thing is impossible
[Prop. 10.79].
Thus, only one medial straight-line, which is commensurable in square only with the whole, and contains a medial (area) with the whole, can be attached to a second

??? ??? ??, ?? ???? [????] ?? ??. ??? ???? ????? ???? producing HM as breadth. Thus, the remaining (square)
?? ??????????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??? ????? ???? on AB is equal to EL [Prop. 2.7]. Thus, AB is the square?? ??, ????? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??. ??? ???? ????? ??? ?? root of EL. Again, let EI, equal to the (sum of the

???? ??? ????? ? ?? ??? ?????????? ?? ?? ?????. ??? ???? And since the sum of the (squares) on AC and CB is me????????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, dial, and is equal to EG, EG is thus also medial. And

EM and MH are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only. Thus, EH is an apotome
[Prop. 10.73], with HM attached to it. So, similarly,
we can show that EH is again an apotome, with HN
attached to it. Thus, different rational (straight-lines),
which are commensurable in square only with the whole,
are attached to an apotome. The very thing was shown

Thus, only one straight-line, which is incommensurable in square with the whole, and (together) with the
whole makes the squares on them (added) together medial, and twice the (rectangle contained) by them medial,
and, moreover, the (sum of the) squares on them incommensurable with the (rectangle contained) by them, can

[Prop. 10.9]. And the square on BG is greater than (the
square on) GC by the (square) on H. Thus, the square on
BG is greater than (the square on) GC by the (square)

Therefore, since as BC is to CD, so the (square) on FG
(is) to the (square) on GH, thus, via conversion, as CB is
to BD, so the (square) on FG (is) to the (square) on K
[Prop. 5.19 corr.]. And CB does not have to BD the ratio which (some) square number (has) to (some) square
number. Thus, the (square) on FG does not have to the
(square) on K the ratio which (some) square number
(has) to (some) square number either. FG is thus incommensurable in length with K [Prop. 10.9]. And the
square on FG is greater than (the square on) GH by the
(square) on K. Thus, the square on FG is greater than
(the square on) GH by the (square) on (some straightline) incommensurable in length with (FG). And neither

????? ??? ??????? ???? ????? ? ??, ???? ???? ???- For since AD is a first apotome, let DG be its at?????????? ? ??? ?? ??, ?? ??? ????? ???? ??????? ????? tachment. Thus, AG and DG are rational (straight-lines
?????????. ??? ??? ? ?? ????????? ???? ?? ????????? ???? which are) commensurable in square only [Prop. 10.73].
?? ??, ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ????????? And the whole, AG, is commensurable (in length) with

????????? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? ??? ??? ?, ?, ? to AG, falling short by a square figure, then it divides
??????? ?? ?? ?????????? ??????? ?? ??, ??, ??. (AG) into (parts which are) commensurable (in length)
??? ???? ????????? ????? ? ?? ?? ?? ?????, ??? ? ?? [Prop. 10.17]. Let DG have been cut in half at E. And

?? ????? ?????. ??? ???? ????????? ????? ? ?? ?? ?? and GK have been drawn through points E, F, and G
?????, ??? ? ?? ??? ??????? ??? ??, ?? ????????? ???? (respectively), parallel to AC.
?????. ???? ?? ? ?? ??? ?????????? ?? ?? ?????? ???? And since AF is commensurable in length with FG,
??? ??? ??????? ??? ??, ?? ??? ?????????? ?? ?? ?????? AG is thus also commensurable in length with each of
???????? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????? ?????. AF and FG [Prop. 10.15]. But AG is commensurable
?????? ?? ?? ??? ?? ???? ?????????? ?? ??, ?? ?? (in length) with AC. Thus, each of AF and FG is also
?? ???? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ?????? ???? ???? commensurable in length with AC [Prop. 10.12]. And
??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???? ??? ????? ??? ????????? ???? ?? AC is a rational (straight-line). Thus, AF and FG (are)
??, ?? ?????????. ???? ????? ????????? ? ??, ??? ??- each also rational (straight-lines). Hence, AI and FK
?????????? ?? ?????. ???? ??? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, are also each rational (areas) [Prop. 10.19]. And since
?? ???????????? ?????????? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?????????, DE is commensurable in length with EG, DG is thus
????? ??? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??. also commensurable in length with each of DE and EG
???? ?? ??? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??, [Prop. 10.15]. And DG (is) rational, and incommen?? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ???? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??? surable in length with AC. DE and EG (are) thus

??? ??, ?? ????? ???????? ?? ??, ?? ?? ???? ?????- [Prop. 10.13]. Thus, DH and EK are each medial (ar???? ???????, ??? ???? ?? [???] ?? ?? ?? ????????? ????, eas) [Prop. 10.21].
?? ?? ?? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ?? ?? ???? ?????. ???? So let the square LM, equal to AI, be laid down.
?? ??? ?? ?? ?? ????? ????, ?? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?? ??? And let the square NO, equal to FK, have been sub387
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??????? ??? ?? ??. ???? ?? ??? ?? tracted (from LM), having with it the common angle
?? ???? ???? ??, ?? ???????????? ?????? ??? ?? ?? ???? LPM. Thus, the squares LM and NO are about the
???? ?? ??. ?? ?? ?? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ??????????? ?? same diagonal [Prop. 6.26]. Let PR be their (com??? ??? ??? ?? ?????????? ???? ???? ?? ??? ? ?? ??? mon) diagonal, and let the (rest of the) figure have been
??????? ?? ??. ???? ??, ??? ? ?? ??????? ?????. drawn. Therefore, since the rectangle contained by AF
????? ??? ????? ????? ???????? ??? ??, ??, ??? ????? and FG is equal to the square EG, thus as AF is to
???? ???? ??, ??, ??? ???????? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????? EG, so EG (is) to FG [Prop. 6.17]. But, as AF (is)
?????, ???????? ?? ??? ???????? ??? ??, ??? ??? ??????? to EG, so AI (is) to EK, and as EG (is) to FG, so
??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ?????. ?????, ???? ????? ???? ?? ?? EK is to KF [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, EK is the mean pro??? ????? ???? ?? ??, ????? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??. ???? ??? ?? portional to AI and KF [Prop. 5.11]. And MN is also
??? ?? ????? ?????, ?? ?? ?? ?????, ?????????? ??? ???? the mean proportional to LM and NO, as shown before
?? ?? ?? ??? ?? ?? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??, ????? ????? ? ?? [Prop. 10.53 lem.]. And AI is equal to the square LM,
???? ??? ??? ?????????? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ?? ?????. and KF to NO. Thus, MN is also equal to EK. But, EK
??? ????? ????????? ?????? ?? ??, ?? ??? ????? ???? ??????? is equal to DH, and MN to LO [Prop. 1.43]. Thus, DK
????? ?????????? ??????? ??? ????? ? ??. ??? ??????? ?? is equal to the gnomon UV W and NO. And AK is also
?? ??????? ? ??? ?? ?? ?????? ???????? ??????? ?????. equal to (the sum of) the squares LM and NO. Thus, the
???? ??? ?????? ?????????? ??? ????? ??? ?? ????. remainder AB is equal to ST . And ST is the square on
LN. Thus, the square on LN is equal to AB. Thus, LN is
the square-root of AB. So, I say that LN is an apotome.
For since AI and FK are each rational (areas), and
are equal to LM and NO (respectively), thus LM and
NO—that is to say, the (squares) on each of LP and PN
(respectively)—are also each rational (areas). Thus, LP
and PN are also each rational (straight-lines). Again,
since DH is a medial (area), and is equal to LO, LO
is thus also a medial (area). Therefore, since LO is
medial, and NO rational, LO is thus incommensurable
with NO. And as LO (is) to NO, so LP is to PN
[Prop. 6.1]. LP is thus incommensurable in length with
PN [Prop. 10.11]. And they are both rational (straightlines). Thus, LP and PN are rational (straight-lines
which are) commensurable in square only. Thus, LN is
an apotome [Prop. 10.73]. And it is the square-root of
area AB. Thus, the square-root of area AB is an apotome.
Thus, if an area is contained by a rational (straightline), and so on . . . .

??, ?? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ?????????, ??? ? ???- For let DG be an attachment to AD. Thus, AG and

?????????? ?? ?? ?????? ???????? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????? (AG) into (parts which are) commensurable (in length)
?????. ?????, ???? ????????? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ??? ? ?? [Prop. 10.17]. Therefore, let DG have been cut in half at

????????? ??? ?? ??? ?? ???? ?????????? ?? ??, ?? also commensurable in length with each of AF and FG

?? ??, ?? ?????????. ???? ????? ????????? ? ??, ??? thus also each rational (straight-lines), and incommen???????????? ?? ?????. ???? ??? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? surable in length with AC [Prop. 10.13]. Thus, AI and
??? ????? ??? ???? ??? ??? ??, ??, ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, FK are each medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21]. Again, since
?? [???] ???? ?????? ??? ?? ??, ?? ??? ????? ???? ??????? DE is commensurable (in length) with EG, thus DG is
????? ?????????. ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ???? ?? also commensurable (in length) with each of DE and EG

???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ?????????? ????? ???????? ?? Therefore, let the square LM, equal to AI, have

???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???? ???? ?? ?? and are equal to the (squares) on LP and PN (respec?????? ? ?? ??? ??????? ?? ?? ??????. ???? [??], ??? ? tively), [thus] the (squares) on LP and PN are also me?? ????? ??????? ???? ?????. dial. Thus, LP and PN are also medial (straight-lines
????? ??? ????? ???? ?? ?? ??? ????? ???? ?? ??, ????? which are) commensurable in square only.† And since
??? ???? ?? ??, ???????? ?? ??? ??? ??, ??. ????? ?? the (rectangle contained) by AF and FG is equal to
??????? ?? ??? ?????????? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?? the (square) on EG, thus as AF is to EG, so EG (is)

??, ?? ??? ?????????? ???? ?????. ?? ??? ??, ?? ????? (is) to EK. And as EG (is) to FG, so EK [is] to FK
???? ??????? ????? ????????? ????? ???????????? ? ?? ??? [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, EK is the mean proportional to AI
389
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
????? ??????? ???? ?????? ??? ??????? ?? ?? ??????. and FK [Prop. 5.11]. And MN is also the mean pro-
?? ??? ?? ?? ?????? ???????? ????? ??????? ???? portional to the squares LM and NO [Prop. 10.53 lem.].
?????? ???? ???? ??????. And AI is equal to LM, and FK to NO. Thus, MN is
also equal to EK. But, DH [is] equal to EK, and LO
equal to MN [Prop. 1.43]. Thus, the whole (of) DK is
equal to the gnomon UV W and NO. Therefore, since the
whole (of) AK is equal to LM and NO, of which DK is
equal to the gnomon UV W and NO, the remainder AB
is thus equal to TS. And TS is the (square) on LN. Thus,
the (square) on LN is equal to the area AB. LN is thus
the square-root of area AB. [So], I say that LN is the
first apotome of a medial (straight-line).
For since EK is a rational (area), and is equal to
LO, LO—that is to say, the (rectangle contained) by LP
and PN—is thus a rational (area). And NO was shown
(to be) a medial (area). Thus, LO is incommensurable
with NO. And as LO (is) to NO, so LP is to PN
[Prop. 6.1]. Thus, LP and PN are incommensurable
in length [Prop. 10.11]. LP and PN are thus medial
(straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only,
and which contain a rational (area). Thus, LN is the first
apotome of a medial (straight-line) [Prop. 10.74]. And it
is the square-root of area AB.
Thus, the square root of area AB is the first apotome
of a medial (straight-line). (Which is) the very thing it
was required to show.
† There is an error in the argument here. It should just say that LP and P N are commensurable in square, rather than in square only, since LP
and P N are only shown to be incommensurable in length later on.

????? ? ?? ?? ??. ???? ? ??? ?? ?? ?? ????????? ???? also commensurable with FK [Props. 6.1, 10.11]. And
????? ? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?????????? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ?? since AF and FG are commensurable in length, AG is
?????. ?? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ???? ?? ?? ???? ?? thus also commensurable in length with each of AF and
??? ?????????? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?? ??. FG [Prop. 10.15]. And AG (is) rational, and incommen????????? ??? ?? ??? ?? ???? ?????????? ?? ??, ?? surable in length with AC. Hence, AF and FG (are)

??? ???? ??? ????? ??? ????????? ???? ?? ??, ??. ???? [Prop. 10.13]. Thus, AI and FK are each medial (ar????? ????????? ? ??, ??? ???????????? ?? ?????. ???? eas) [Prop. 10.21]. Again, since DE is commensurable
??? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ????? ??? in length with EG, DG is also commensurable in length
?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??. ???? ?? with each of DE and EG [Prop. 10.15]. And GD (is)
??? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ???? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??? ?? rational, and incommensurable in length with AC. Thus,
?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ???? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? DE and EG (are) each also rational, and incommensu?? ??? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??, ????? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? rable in length with AC [Prop. 10.13]. DH and EK are
??? ??, ?? ????? ???????? ???? ?? ??. ???? ?? ??? ??? thus each medial (areas) [Prop. 10.21]. And since AG
??, ?? ?????????? ????? ???????? ?? ??? ??? ????? and GD are commensurable in square only, AG is thus
???? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ?? ?? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? incommensurable in length with GD. But, AG is com???? ???? ?? ??. ???? ?? ??? ?? ???? ???? ?? ??, ?? mensurable in length with AF, and DG with EG. Thus,
?? ?? ???? [????] ?? ??? ??? ???? ??? ?? ?? ???? ???? AF is incommensurable in length with EG [Prop. 10.13].
?? ??? ??????? ??? ?? ??. ???? ?? ??? ?? ?? ???? ???? And as AF (is) to EG, so AI is to EK [Prop. 6.1]. Thus,
??, ??? ?????? ??? ?? ?? ???? ???? ?? ??, ???????? ?? AI is incommensurable with EK [Prop. 10.11].
??? ??? ?? ?????????? ? ?? ??? ??????? ?? ?? ??????. Therefore, let the square LM, equal to AI, have
????, ??? ? ?? ????? ??????? ???? ???????. been constructed. And let NO, equal to FK, which is
????? ??? ???? ??????? ?? ??, ?? ??? ????? ??? ???? ??? about the same angle as LM, have been subtracted (from
??? ??, ??, ????? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ??? ??? ??, LM). Thus, LM and NO are about the same diagonal
??? ???? ??? ??????? ??? ??, ??. ??? ???? ????????? [Prop. 6.26]. Let PR be their (common) diagonal, and
???? ?? ?? ?? ??, ????????? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? let the (rest of the) figure have been drawn. Therefore,
??? ??? ??. ?????, ???? ?????????? ??????? ?? ?? ?? ??, since the (rectangle contained) by AF and FG is equal
?????????? ??? ???? ??? ?? ?? ?? ??, ???????? ?? ??? to the (square) on EG, thus as AF is to EG, so EG (is)
??? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??, ??? ???? ??? ? ?? ?????????? to FG [Prop. 6.17]. But, as AF (is) to EG, so AI is to

?????????. ???? ??, ??? ??? ????? ???????????. [Prop. 6.1]. And thus as AI (is) to EK, so EK (is) to
????? ??? ????? ??????? ?? ?? ??? ????? ???? ?? ??? FK [Prop. 5.11]. Thus, EK is the mean proportional to
??? ??, ??, ????? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, ??? AI and FK. And MN is also the mean proportional to
???? ?? ??, ?? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ????????? ????? the squares LM and NO [Prop. 10.53 lem.]. And AI is
391
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
???????????. ? ?? ??? ????? ??????? ???? ???????? ??? equal to LM, and FK to NO. Thus, EK is also equal to
??????? ?? ?? ??????. MN. But, MN is equal to LO, and EK [is] equal to DH
?? ??? ?? ?? ?????? ???????? ????? ??????? ???? [Prop. 1.43]. And thus the whole of DK is equal to the
???????? ???? ???? ??????. gnomon UV W and NO. And AK (is) also equal to LM
and NO. Thus, the remainder AB is equal to ST—that is
to say, to the square on LN. Thus, LN is the square-root
of area AB. I say that LN is the second apotome of a
medial (straight-line).
For since AI and FK were shown (to be) medial (areas), and are equal to the (squares) on LP and PN (respectively), the (squares) on each of LP and PN (are)
thus also medial. Thus, LP and PN (are) each medial
(straight-lines). And since AI is commensurable with
FK [Props. 6.1, 10.11], the (square) on LP (is) thus
also commensurable with the (square) on PN. Again,
since AI was shown (to be) incommensurable with EK,
LM is thus also incommensurable with MN—that is to
say, the (square) on LP with the (rectangle contained)
by LP and PN. Hence, LP is also incommensurable in
length with PN [Props. 6.1, 10.11]. Thus, LP and PN
are medial (straight-lines which are) commensurable in
square only. So, I say that they also contain a medial
(area).
For since EK was shown (to be) a medial (area), and
is equal to the (rectangle contained) by LP and PN, the
(rectangle contained) by LP and PN is thus also medial.
Hence, LP and PN are medial (straight-lines which are)
commensurable in square only, and which contain a medial (area). Thus, LN is the second apotome of a medial
(straight-line) [Prop. 10.75]. And it is the square-root of
area AB.
Thus, the square-root of area AB is the second apotome of a medial (straight-line). (Which is) the very thing
it was required to show.

?????????. ???? ????? ???????? ? ??, ??? ???????????? is rational, and commensurable in length with AC, the

STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
For since AK is rational, and is equal to the (sum of
the) squares LP and PN, the sum of the (squares) on
LP and PN is thus rational. Again, since DK is medial, and DK is equal to twice the (rectangle contained)
by LP and PN, thus twice the (rectangle contained) by
LP and PN is medial. And since AI was shown (to be)
incommensurable with FK, the square on LP (is) thus
also incommensurable with the square on PN. Thus, LP
and PN are (straight-lines which are) incommensurable
in square, making the sum of the squares on them rational, and twice the (rectangle contained) by them medial. LN is thus the irrational (straight-line) called minor
[Prop. 10.76]. And it is the square-root of area AB.
Thus, the square-root of area AB is a minor (straightline). (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

??, ??? ??? ?????. [Prop. 10.22]. And since the (sum of the squares) on AG
????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????? ???????? ???? and GB is rational, and twice the (rectangle contained)
?? ??? ??? ??, ??, ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? by AG and GB medial, the (sum of the squares) on AG

?? ??? ??? ??, ???????? ?? ??????? ????? ??? ??? ??? with FM [Prop. 10.11]. And both are rational (straight??. ??? ???? ????????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? lines). Thus, CM and MF are rational (straight-lines
??, ????????? [????] ??? ?? ?? ?? ??. ?? ?? ?? ?? ???? which are) commensurable in square only. CF is thus an
?? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??? ????????? ??? ????? ? apotome [Prop. 10.73]. So, I say that (it is) also a first
?? ?? ??. ???? ??? ??? ??????? ?????? ????? ?? ??, ??, (apotome).
??? ?? ??????? ????? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???? ??? ?? For since the (rectangle contained) by AG and GB is
???????????? ???????? ????? ????????? ?? ??? ??? ??, the mean proportional to the (squares) on AG and GB
??, ??? ???? ????????? ? ?? ?? ??, ? ??? ?? ??? ?? [Prop. 10.21 lem.], and CH is equal to the (square) on

?? ????????? ?? ????????? ???? ?? ?? ?????? ? ??? ?? the (rectangle contained) by AG and GB, NL is thus
??????? ???? ?????. also the mean proportional to CH and KL. Thus, as
?? ??? ??? ???????? ???? ????? ?????????????? CH is to NL, so NL (is) to KL. But, as CH (is) to
?????? ????? ???????? ??????? ???? ???? ??????. NL, so CK is to NM, and as NL (is) to KL, so NM
is to KM [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, the (rectangle contained)
by CK and KM is equal to the (square) on NM—
that is to say, to the fourth part of the (square) on FM
[Prop. 6.17]. And since the (square) on AG is commensurable with the (square) on GB, CH [is] also commensurable with KL. And as CH (is) to KL, so CK (is) to
KM [Prop. 6.1]. CK is thus commensurable (in length)
with KM [Prop. 10.11]. Therefore, since CM and MF
are two unequal straight-lines, and the (rectangle contained) by CK and KM, equal to the fourth part of the
(square) on FM, has been applied to CM, falling short
by a square figure, and CK is commensurable (in length)
with KM, the square on CM is thus greater than (the
square on) MF by the (square) on (some straight-line)
commensurable in length with (CM) [Prop. 10.17]. And
CM is commensurable in length with the (previously)
laid down rational (straight-line) CD. Thus, CF is a first
apotome [Def. 10.15].
Thus, the (square) on an apotome, applied to a rational (straight-line), produces a first apotome as breadth.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

??? ???? ??? ???? ??? ? ?? ??? ????????? ?? ?? ?????. is thus rational, and incommensurable in length with CD
???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ??, ???????? ?? ??, ????? [Prop. 10.22]. And since CL is equal to the (sum of the

?????????? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?? ??. ?? ?? ?? ?? ???? ?? is equal to CE, the remainder, twice the (rectangle con??, ????? ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??? ?????????? ??? ? tained) by AG and GB, is thus equal to FL [Prop. 2.7].

FM is thus also rational, and commensurable in length
with CD [Prop. 10.20]. Therefore, since the (sum of the
squares) on AG and GB—that is to say, CL—is medial,
and twice the (rectangle contained) by AG and GB—
that is to say, FL—(is) rational, CL is thus incommensurable with FL. And as CL (is) to FL, so CM is to
FM [Prop. 6.1]. Thus, CM (is) incommensurable in
length with FM [Prop. 10.11]. And they are both rational (straight-lines). Thus, CM and MF are rational
(straight-lines which are) commensurable in square only.
CF is thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73]. So, I say that (it

Thus, the (rectangle contained) by CK and KM is equal

404
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
??. ??? ???? ?????????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? CL is thus incommensurable with FL. And as CL (is) to
??, ???? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ?? ??? ??? FL, so CM (is) to MF [Prop. 6.1]. CM is thus incom?? ?? ??, ?????????? ??? ?? ?? ?? ??. ?? ?? ?? ?? mensurable in length with MF [Prop. 10.11]. And both
???? ?? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??? ?????????? ??? are rational. Thus, CM and MF are rational (straight? ?? ?? ?? ?????. ???? ??? ??? ??????? ?????? ????? ?? lines which are) commensurable in square only. CF is
??, ??, ??? ?? ??????? ????? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???? thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73]. So, I say that (it is) also

????????? ????? ???????, ? ??? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ??????? For, similarly (to the previous propositions), we can

?? ????????? ?? ????????? ???? ?? ??? ? ??? ?? ??????? the (square) on NM—that is to say, to the fourth part

is incommensurable with the (square) on GB, and the
(square) on AG (is) equal to CH, and the (square) on
GB to KL, CH (is) thus incommensurable with KL.
And as CH (is) to KL, so CK (is) to KM [Prop. 6.1].
Thus, CK (is) incommensurable in length with KM
[Prop. 10.11]. Therefore, since CM and MF are two unequal straight-lines, and (some area), equal to the fourth
part of the (square) on FM, has been applied to CM,
falling short by a square figure, and divides it into incommensurable (parts), the square on CM is thus greater
than (the square on) MF by the (square) on (some
straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with (CM)
[Prop. 10.18]. And the attachment FM is commensurable with the (previously) laid down rational (straightline) CD. Thus, CF is a fifth apotome [Def. 10.15].

?????. ??? ???? ????? ??? ?? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ??? CM is rational, and incommensurable in length with

??? ??? ??, ?? ????? ???????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, CF is thus an apotome [Prop. 10.73]. So, I say that (it
??, ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??, ?? ?? ??? is) also a sixth (apotome).
??? ?? ???? ?? ??, ?? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ?? ??, For since FL is equal to twice the (rectangle con??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????? ???????? ???? ?? ??? ????? ??? tained) by AG and GB, let FM have been cut in half
?? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??, ????? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??. ??? ??? at N, and let NO have been drawn through N, parallel

???? ?? ??? ? ?? ??? ??????? ????? ????? ???? ???? ??????. are incommensurable in square, the (square) on AG is
thus incommensurable with the (square) on GB. But,
CH is equal to the (square) on AG, and KL is equal
to the (square) on GB. Thus, CH is incommensurable
with KL. And as CH (is) to KL, so CK is to KM
[Prop. 6.1]. Thus, CK is incommensurable (in length)
with KM [Prop. 10.11]. And since the (rectangle contained) by AG and GB is the mean proportional to the
(squares) on AG and GB [Prop. 10.21 lem.], and CH
is equal to the (square) on AG, and KL equal to the
(square) on GB, and NL equal to the (rectangle contained) by AG and GB, NL is thus also the mean proportional to CH and KL. Thus, as CH is to NL, so NL
(is) to KL. And for the same (reasons as the preceding propositions), the square on CM is greater than (the
square on) MF by the (square) on (some straight-line)
406
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
incommensurable (in length) with (CM) [Prop. 10.18].
And neither of them is commensurable with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) CD. Thus, CF
is a sixth apotome [Def. 10.16]. (Which is) the very thing

rational (straight-line) FG. Thus, KH is a first apotome
[Def. 10.1]. And the square-root of an (area) contained
by a rational (straight-line) and a first apotome is an apotome [Prop. 10.91]. Thus, the square-root of LH—that

And if the square on HF is greater than (the square
on) FK by the (square) on (some straight-line which is)
incommensurable (in length) with (HF), and (since) the
whole of FH is commensurable in length with the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) FG, KH is a
fourth apotome [Prop. 10.14]. And the square-root of an
(area) contained by a rational (straight-line) and a fourth
apotome is a minor (straight-line) [Prop. 10.94]. (Which
is) the very thing it was required to show.

The remainder GF is thus commensurable in length with
DF [Prop. 10.15]. [Therefore, since DF is commensurable with GF, and DF is rational, GF is thus also rational. Therefore, since DF is commensurable in length
with GF,] DF (is) incommensurable in length with EF.
Thus, FG is also incommensurable in length with EF
[Prop. 10.13]. GF and FE [are] thus rational (straightlines which are) commensurable in square only. Thus,

EG is an apotome [Prop. 10.73]. But, (it is) also rational. The very thing is impossible.

?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ? Thus, G is also greater than EF [Props. 5.16, 5.14]. Let

Therefore, if the square on CD is greater than (the

on FK will also be greater than (the square on) KE by
the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in

10.12]. And if BD (is commensurable), (so) also (is)
KE [Prop. 10.12]. And if neither of CD or DB (is commensurable), neither also (are) either of FK or KE.
And if the square on CD is greater than (the square

FK will also be greater than (the square on) KE by
the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable

[Prop. 10.12]. And if neither of CD or DB (is commensurable), neither also (are) either of FK or KE. Hence,
FE is an apotome whose terms, FK and KE, are commensurable (in length) with the terms, CD and DB, of
the binomial, and in the same ratio. And (FE) has the
same order as BC [Defs. 10.5—10.10]. (Which is) the

???????? ???? ???? ??? ?? ??????? ??? ?? ?? ???? ????, produces KH as breadth. I say that KH is a binomial
??? ??? ? ?? ??? ????? ???? ????? ?? ??. whose terms are commensurable with the terms of BD,
????? ??? ?? ?? ????????????? ? ??? ?? ??, ?? and in the same ratio, and, moreover, that KH has the
??? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ?????????. ??? ?? ??? ??? same order as BD.
? ???? ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?. ????? ?? ?? ??? ??? For let DC be an attachment to BD. Thus, BC and
?? ????? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?. ??? ???? ????? ??? CD are rational (straight-lines which are) commensu?? ????????????? ???? ??? ????? ? ? ??? ????????? ?? ?? rable in square only [Prop. 10.73]. And let the (rectangle
?????. ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, ? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??? contained) by BC and G also be equal to the (square)
??, ??, ???????? ??? ????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??, ????? ? on A. And the (square) on A (is) rational. The (rect?? ???? ?. ?????? ?? ? ?? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ??? ? ?? angle contained) by BC and G (is) thus also rational.
??? ?. ?????? ?? ? ??? ? ??? ????????? ??? ????? ? ?? And it has been applied to the rational (straight-line)
?? ?? ?????. ??? ???? ????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??, ????? ? BC. Thus, G is rational, and commensurable in length
?? ???? ??, ???????????? ??? ????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? with BC [Prop. 10.20]. Therefore, since the (rectangle
??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??. ???????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??, contained) by BC and G is equal to the (rectangle con????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??? ????? ??? ? ?? ???? ?? ?????, tained) by BD and KH, thus, proportionally, as CB is to
?? ? ?? ???? ??, ????????? [??] ? ?? ???? ??. ?? ?? BD, so KH (is) to G [Prop. 6.16]. And BC (is) greater
??, ?? ??????? ????? [????] ?????????? ??? ?? ??, ?? ??? than BD. Thus, KH (is) also greater than G [Prop. 5.16,
??????? ????? ???? ?????????? ??? ???? ????? ?? ? ?? ???? 5.14]. Let KE be made equal to G. KE is thus com??, ? ?? ???? ??, ???? ?? ? ?? ???? ??, ? ?? ???? mensurable in length with BC. And since as CB is to
??, ??? ?? ??? ? ?? ???? ??, ? ?? ???? ??? ???? ??? BD, so HK (is) to KE, thus, via conversion, as BC (is)
?? ? ????? ???? ??? ??????, ?? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ?? to CD, so KH (is) to HE [Prop. 5.19 corr.]. Let it have
??? ??? ????????? ??? ?? ??? ? ?? ???? ??, ????? ?? ??? been contrived that as KH (is) to HE, so HF (is) to
??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??. ????????? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? FE. And thus the remainder KF is to FH, as KH (is)
?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??, ?? ??????? ???? ?????????? to HE—that is to say, [as] BC (is) to CD [Prop. 5.19].
????????? ??? ???? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ?????? ???? ? ?? ??? And BC and CD [are] commensurable in square only.
419
STOIQEIWN iþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 10
?? ?? ????????? [????] ?????. ???? ?? ????? ? ?? ??? KF and FH are thus also commensurable in square only
????????? ?? ?? ?????. ???? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? ????????? [Prop. 10.11]. And since as KH is to HE, (so) KF (is)
?? ?? ?????. ??? ???? ????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??, ????? ? ?? to FH, but as KH (is) to HE, (so) HF (is) to FE, thus,
???? ??, ??????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??. also as KF (is) to FH, (so) HF (is) to FE [Prop. 5.11].
????????? ?? ? ?? ?? ??? ????????? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? And hence as the first (is) to the third, so the (square) on
?????. ?? ??, ?? ?? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ?????????? the first (is) to the (square) on the second [Def. 5.9]. And
??? ?? ??, ?? ??? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ?????????? ?? thus as KF (is) to FE, so the (square) on KF (is) to the
??? ???????? ????? ??? ? ??. (square) on FH. And the (square) on KF is commen?? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? surable with the (square) on FH. For KF and FH are
????????? ?????, ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ????????? ?? commensurable in square. Thus, KF is also commensu??? ????????? ?????. ??? ?? ??? ????????? ????? ? ?? ?? rable in length with FE [Prop. 10.11]. Hence, KF [is]
????????? ???? ?????, ??? ? ??, ?? ?? ? ?? ????????? ???? also commensurable in length with KE [Prop. 10.15].
?? ????????? ???? ?????, ??? ? ??, ?? ?? ???????? ??? ??, And KE is rational, and commensurable in length with
??, ???????? ??? ??, ??. BC. Thus, KF (is) also rational, and commensurable in
?? ?? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????????? length with BC [Prop. 10.12]. And since as BC is to
?????, ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ????????? ?? ??? ????????- CD, (so) KF (is) to FH, alternately, as BC (is) to KF,
?? ?????. ??? ?? ??? ????????? ????? ? ?? ?? ????????? so DC (is) to FH [Prop. 5.16]. And BC (is) commen???? ?????, ??? ? ??, ?? ?? ? ??, ??? ? ??, ?? ?? ???????? surable (in length) with KF. Thus, FH (is) also com??? ??, ??, ???????? ??? ??, ??. mensurable in length with CD [Prop. 10.11]. And BC
??? ??? ??? ???????? ????? ? ??, ?? ?? ??????? ?? and CD are rational (straight-lines which are) commen??, ?? ???????? [????] ???? ??? ???????? ??????? ???? surable in square only. KF and FH are thus also ratio??, ?? ??? ?? ?? ???? ????, ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ??? nal (straight-lines which are) commensurable in square
????? ???? ?????? ???? ???? ??????. only [Def. 10.3, Prop. 10.13]. Thus, KH is a binomial
[Prop. 10.36].
Therefore, if the square on BC is greater than (the
square on) CD by the (square) on (some straight-line)
commensurable (in length) with (BC), then the square
on KF will also be greater than (the square on) FH by
the (square) on (some straight-line) commensurable (in
length) with (KF) [Prop. 10.14]. And if BC is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), (so) also (is) KF [Prop. 10.12].
And if CD is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), (so) also (is)
FH [Prop. 10.12]. And if neither of BC or CD (are
commensurable), neither also (are) either of KF or FH
[Prop. 10.13].
And if the square on BC is greater than (the square
on) CD by the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable (in length) with (BC) then the square on
KF will also be greater than (the square on) FH by
the (square) on (some straight-line) incommensurable
(in length) with (KF) [Prop. 10.14]. And if BC is commensurable in length with a (previously) laid down rational (straight-line), (so) also (is) KF [Prop. 10.12]. And
if CD is commensurable, (so) also (is) FH [Prop. 10.12].
And if neither of BC or CD (are commensurable), neither also (are) either of KF or FH [Prop. 10.13].
KH is thus a binomial whose terms, KF and FH,
[are] commensurable (in length) with the terms, BC and
CD, of the apotome, and in the same ratio. Moreover,
420

KH will have the same order as BC [Defs. 10.5—10.10].
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

And let the square-root

????? ? ??, ?? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ??, ?? ???????? ???? For let the rational (straight-line) H be laid down.
??? ?? ??? ???????? ??????? ???? ??, ?? ??? ?? ?? ???? And let (some rectangle), equal to the (square) on H,

??? ?? ?? ???? ????? ????? ??? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, Thus, KL is an apotome, of which let the terms, KM

But, CE and ED are also commensu?? ? ?? ?? ??? ????????? ??? ???? ??? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? rable with AF and FB (respectively), and in the same ra????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??, ????? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? tio. Thus, as AF is to FB, so KM (is) to ML. Thus, alter?? ??? ??? ??, ??? ????????? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? nately, as AF is to KM, so BF (is) to LM [Prop. 5.16].
??, ?? ?? ??? ??? ??, ??. ???? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? Thus, the remainder AB is also to the remainder KL as

?? ??? ??? ?? ????? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ??? so the (rectangle contained) by CD and AB (is) to the

the (square) on H. And the (square) on G is equal to the
(rectangle contained) by CD and AB. The (square) on G
421

is thus commensurable with the (square) on H. And the
(square) on H (is) rational. Thus, the (square) on G is
also rational. G is thus rational. And it is the square-root
of the (rectangle contained) by CD and AB.
Thus, if an area is contained by an apotome, and a
binomial whose terms are commensurable with, and in
the same ratio as, the terms of the apotome, then the
square-root of the area is a rational (straight-line).

??? ??? ?? ?????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?. ?????? ??? ????? For an (area contained) by an irrational and a rational

D be equal to the (rectangle contained) by B and C.
Thus, the (square) on D is irrational [Prop. 10.20]. D
is thus irrational [Def. 10.4]. And (D is) not the same as
any of the preceding (straight-lines). For the (square) on
none of the preceding (straight-lines), applied to a rational (straight-line), produces C as breadth. So, similarly,
this arrangement being advanced to infinity, it is clear
that an infinite (series) of irrational (straight-lines) can
be created from a medial (straight-line), and that none of

????????????? ??? ?? ??, ??, ??, ?? ???? ????????, For let AE, EB, CE and ED have been cut off from
??? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ?, ?? ??????, ? ???, ??? (the two straight-lines so as to be) equal to one another.
???????????? ?? ??, ??, ??? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ? And let GEH have been drawn, at random, through E
???????????? ?? ??, ??, ??, ??, ??, ??. (in the plane passing through AB and CD). And let AD

?????, ??? ?? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ??????? ???? ?????? random (point) F (on EF).
???? ??? ????? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ??? [?????]. For since the two (straight-lines) AE and ED are
???? ?? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ???. ??? ?? equal to the two (straight-lines) CE and EB, and they
??????? ???? ?? ???, ??? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ??????? enclose equal angles [Prop. 1.15], the base AD is thus
???? ?????? ???????? ??????? ??? ???? ??????? ??? ?????? equal to the base CB, and triangle AED will be equal
???? ??? ???? ???? ????? ??????? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? to triangle CEB [Prop. 1.4]. Hence, the angle DAE
?????? ??? ??????? ???? ??????? ???????? ???? ???????. ??? [is] equal to the angle EBC. And the angle AEG (is)
??? ? ??? ?? ?? ??, ? ?? ?? ?? ??. ??? ???? ??? ????? ? also equal to the angle BEH [Prop. 1.15]. So AGE
?? ?? ??, ????? ?? ??? ???? ????? ? ??, ????? ??? ? ?? and BEH are two triangles having two angles equal to
????? ?? ?? ????? ???. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ????? two angles, respectively, and one side equal to one side—
???. ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ???? ?? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? (namely), those by the equal angles, AE and EB. Thus,
???, ??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? ??, ?? ???? ????? ??????? they will also have the remaining sides equal to the re???????? ??? ????? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ??????? ???? ??? ????? maining sides [Prop. 1.26]. Thus, GE (is) equal to EH,
??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?????. ??? ???? ????? and AG to BH. And since AE is equal to EB, and FE
??????? ? ?? ?? ?? ???, ???? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ???, ??? is common and at right-angles, the base FA is thus equal
?? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? ??, ?? ???? ?????. ??? ????? ? ??? to the base FB [Prop. 1.4]. So, for the same (reasons),
??? ??????? ??? ?? ??? ???? ????? ??? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? FC is also equal to FD. And since AD is equal to CB,
????? ???. ??? ???? ????? ??? ??????? ? ?? ?? ??, ????? ?? and FA is also equal to FB, the two (straight-lines) FA
? ??, ??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? ??, ?? ???? ?????? ??? and AD are equal to the two (straight-lines) FB and BC,
????? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ???? ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? respectively. And the base FD was shown (to be) equal
?? ??? ??? ??? ?????. ???? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ???, to the base FC. Thus, the angle FAD is also equal to
??? ??????. ? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ???????? ??? ??? the angle FBC [Prop. 1.8]. And, again, since AG was

428
STOIQEIWN iaþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 11
???? ????? ??? ????????? ????? ??????? ??? ????? ?? ?? FB, the two (straight-lines) FA and AG are equal to the

???????? ???? ?????, ???? ???? ????? ??? ????????? ????? angle FAG was shown (to be) equal to the angle FBH.
??????? ??? ????? ?? ?? ???? ??????? ????? ???? ??????? Thus, the base FG is equal to the base FH [Prop. 1.4].
? ?? ??? ?? ?????????? ??????? ???? ????? ?????. ?? ?? And, again, since GE was shown (to be) equal to EH,
??????????? ???????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???????. ? and EF (is) common, the two (straight-lines) GE and
?? ??? ???? ????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???????. EF are equal to the two (straight-lines) HE and EF
???? ??? ?????? ??? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ???? (respectively). And the base FG (is) equal to the base
????? ??? ??? ?????? ????? ????????, ??? ?? ??? ????? FH. Thus, the angle GEF is equal to the angle HEF
??????? ???? ????? ?????? ???? ???? ??????. [Prop. 1.8]. Each of the angles GEF and HEF (are)
thus right-angles [Def. 1.10]. Thus, FE is at right-angles
to GH, which was drawn at random through E (in the
reference plane passing though AB and AC). So, similarly, we can show that FE will make right-angles with
all straight-lines joined to it which are in the reference
plane. And a straight-line is at right-angles to a plane
when it makes right-angles with all straight-lines joined
to it which are in the plane [Def. 11.3]. Thus, FE is at
right-angles to the reference plane. And the reference
plane is that (passing) through the straight-lines AB and
CD. Thus, FE is at right-angles to the plane (passing)
through AB and CD.
Thus, if a straight-line is set up at right-angles to two
straight-lines cutting one another, at the common point
of section, then it will also be at right-angles to the plane
(passing) through them (both). (Which is) the very thing
it was required to show.

Thus, the three straight-lines BC, BD, and BE are in

every triangle is in one plane [Prop. 11.2]. And each of

Thus, if two straight-lines are at right-angles to

In other words, the two straight-lines lie in the same plane, and never meet when produced in either direction.

?????. ???? ?? ? ??? ???? ???? ??? ??? ? ??? ???? ? ?? [Prop. 11.9], the (sum of the) angles GBA and BGH is
??? ?? ?? ???? ????? ?????. ??? ?? ???? ?? ? ?? ??? ?? equal to two right-angles [Prop. 1.29]. And BGH (is)

the very thing it was required to show.
† This proposition is only proved for the case of a solid angle contained by three plane angles. However, the generalization to a solid angle
contained by more than three plane angles is straightforward.

???????? ???????????. ?? ?? ??, ??????? ??????, ??? ??- Now, if the angles ABC, DEF, and GHK are equal

?????. ????? ??? ?? ??, ?? ??? ?? ???????? ?????. ??? ?? [Prop. 1.4]. And since (the sum of) ABC and GHK
? ?? ?? ??? ?? ??, ?? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ?? ???????? is greater than DEF, and ABC equal to KHL, GHL

[Prop. 1.24]. But, (the sum of) GK and KL is greater
than GL [Prop. 1.20]. Thus, (the sum of) GK and KL is
much greater than DF. And KL (is) equal to AC. Thus,
(the sum of) AC and GK is greater than the remaining
(straight-line) DF. So, similarly, we can show that (the
sum of) AC and DF is greater than GK, and, further,
that (the sum of) DF and GK is greater than AC. Thus,
it is possible to construct a triangle from (straight-lines)

????, ??? ? ?? ?????? ???? ??? ??. ?? ??? ??, ???? I say that AB is greater than LO. For, if not, AB is

????? ???. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? to the base LM. Thus, angle ABC is equal to angle
????? ???, ??? ??? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???? ?? ??? ????? ?? LOM [Prop. 1.8]. So, for the same (reasons), DEF is
??? ???, ???, ??? ?????? ????? ???? ??? ???, ???, also equal to MON, and, further, GHK to NOL. Thus,
??? ????? ????. ???? ?? ????? ?? ??? ???, ???, ??? the three angles ABC, DEF, and GHK are equal to the
????????? ?????? ????? ????? ??? ?? ????? ??? ?? ??? ???, three angles LOM, MON, and NOL, respectively. But,
???, ??? ????????? ?????? ???? ?????. ?????????? ?? ??? the (sum of the) three angles LOM, MON, and NOL is

?? ?? ?? ??? ? ??, ??? ????????? ? ??. ??? ???? ??? ????? right-angles. The very thing (is) absurd. Thus, AB is
? ?? ?? ??, ??? ???? ??? ? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??? ????? ? not equal to LO. So, I say that AB is not less than LO
?? ?? ?? ????? ???. ?????????? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, either. For, if possible, let it be (less). And let OP be
??? ????????? ?? ??? ?? ???? ????? ??? ?? ? ?? ???? made equal to AB, and OQ equal to BC, and let PQ
??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??, have been joined. And since AB is equal to BC, OP
????? ? ?? ???? ??. ?????? ?? ? ?? ??? ??? ?????? ??? is also equal to OQ. Hence, the remainder LP is also
??? ? ?? ??? ??. ???? ? ?? ?????? ?? ?? ???? ??? ? ?? equal to (the remainder) QM. LM is thus parallel to PQ
??? ??? ?? ?????? ?????. ???? ??? ??? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? [Prop. 6.2], and (triangle) LMO (is) equiangular with

?????, ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ?????? OP (is) to PQ [Prop. 6.4]. Alternately, as LO (is) to OP,
?????. ?????? ?? ????????, ??? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? so LM (is) to PQ [Prop. 5.16]. And LO (is) greater than

????? ?????? ?? ??? ???, ???, ??? ????? ??? ??? ???, But LM was made equal to AC. Thus, AC is also greater

? ?????? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?????? ???? So let OR have been set up at point O at right????????? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???? ???? angles to the plane of circle LMN [Prop. 11.12]. And

???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??. ???? ?? ??? ?? [Prop. 11.23 lem.]. And let RL, RM, and RN have been

??????? ??? ??, ??? ?????? ??? ??? ??, ??, ??, ??, And since RO is at right-angles to the plane of cir??, ?? ?????? ??? ??, ??, ?? ??? ?????. ??? ???? ??? cle LMN, RO is thus also at right-angles to each of LO,
?? ??, ?? ???? ???? ??, ?? ???? ?????, ??? ????? ? ?? MO, and NO. And since LO is equal to OM, and OR
????? ?? ?? ????????? ???, ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? is common and at right-angles, the base RL is thus equal
?? ??? ??? ????? ???. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? to the base RM [Prop. 1.4]. So, for the same (reasons),
?? ??? ??? ????? ???, ? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???. RN is also equal to each of RL and RM. Thus, the three
??? ????? ??? ?????? ???????? ??? ??? ???, ???, (straight-lines) RL, RM, and RN are equal to one an???, ?? ????? ???? ????? ???? ????????? ???? ??? ???, ???, other. And since the (square) on OR was assumed to
???, ?????? ????? ?????????? ? ???? ?? ? ??????????? be equal to that (area) by which the (square) on AB is
??? ??? ???, ???, ??? ??????? ???? ???? ???????. greater than the (square) on LO, the (square) on AB
is thus equal to the (sum of the squares) on LO and
OR. And the (square) on LR is equal to the (sum of
the squares) on LO and OR. For LOR (is) a right-angle
[Prop. 1.47]. Thus, the (square) on AB is equal to the
(square) on RL. Thus, AB (is) equal to RL. But, each
of BC, DE, EF, GH, and HK is equal to AB, and each
of RM and RN equal to RL. Thus, each of AB, BC,
DE, EF, GH, and HK is equal to each of RL, RM,
and RN. And since the two (straight-lines) LR and RM
are equal to the two (straight-lines) AB and BC (respectively), and the base LM was assumed (to be) equal to
the base AC, the angle LRM is thus equal to the angle
ABC [Prop. 1.8]. So, for the same (reasons), MRN is
also equal to DEF, and LRN to GHK.
Thus, the solid angle R, contained by the angles
LRM, MRN, and LRN, has been constructed out of
the three plane angles LRM, MRN, and LRN, which
are equal to the three given (plane angles) ABC, DEF,
and GHK (respectively). (Which is) the very thing it was
required to do.

???? ?????? ?? ??, ??, ?? ??? ???????? ?????? ???- Thus, three planes of (one of) the solids LQ, KR, and

†
???????, ??? ?????????, ??? ?? ???????? ? ?? ????? ??? ?? And if the base LF exceeds the base NF then the solid

of the base AF and the solid AU— (namely), the base
LF and the solid LU—and of the base HF and the solid
HU—(namely), the base NF and the solid NU. And it
has been shown that if the base LF exceeds the base FN
then the solid LU also exceeds the [solid] NU, and if
(LF is) equal (to FN) then (LU is) equal (to NU), and
if (LF is) less than (FN) then (LU is) less than (NU).
Thus, as the base AF is to the base FH, so the solid AU
(is) to the solid UH [Def. 5.5]. (Which is) the very thing

??? ??????. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ???, (EDC), it will also make right-angles with all of the
??? ?????? ???? ?????. ??? ???? ??? ?? ??, ?? ??? straight-lines joined to it which are also in the reference
???? ??, ?? ???? ????? ??????? ???????, ??? ?????? ???? plane [Def. 11.3]. Thus, the angles FGD and FGE
???????????, ????? ??? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ??? ?????. ???? are right-angles. So, for the same (reasons), the an?? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??? ?????? ????? ???????????? ??? gles HKA and HKB are also right-angles. And since
??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??. ????? ???? ??? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? the two (straight-lines) KA and AB are equal to the two
??, ?? ???? ?????, ??? ?????? ????? ???????????, ????? ??? (straight-lines) GD and DE, respectively, and they con? ?? ????? ?? ?? ??? ?????. ???? ?? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ???? tain equal angles, the base KB is thus equal to the base
??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ??? ???? ??, ?? ???? ?????. ??? ????? ? GE [Prop. 1.4]. And KH is also equal to GF. And they
?? ????? ?? ?? ???? ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? contain right-angles (with the respective bases). Thus,
??? ????? ???. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? HB (is) also equal to FE [Prop. 1.4]. Again, since the

??????????? ???? ???? ???????. FD [Prop. 1.4]. And AB (is) also equal to DE. So,
the two (straight-lines) HA and AB are equal to the two
(straight-lines) DF and DE (respectively). And the base
HB (is) equal to the base FE. Thus, the angle BAH is
equal to the angle EDF [Prop. 1.8]. So, for the same
(reasons), HAL is also equal to FDC. And BAL is also
equal to EDC.
Thus, (a solid angle) has been constructed, equal to
the given solid angle at D, on the given straight-line AB,
452

at the given point A on it. (Which is) the very thing it
was required to do.
kzþ. Proposition 27
???? ??? ???????? ??????? ?? ??????? ?????? ???????- To describe a parallelepiped solid similar, and simi???????? ?????? ?? ??? ?????? ???????? ??????? ???????- larly laid out, to a given parallelepiped solid on a given

????? ? ??? ??????? ?????? ? ??, ?? ?? ????? ??????? Let the given straight-line be AB, and the given par???????????????? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ???????? ??????? allelepiped solid CD. So, it is necessary to describe a

?????? ?? ??? ?????? ???????? ??????? ???????????????? given parallelepiped solid CD on the given straight-line
?????????. AB.
????????? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?????? ??? ?? ???? ???? For, let a (solid angle) contained by the (plane angles)
?????? ?? ? ?? ???? ?? ? ?????? ????? ??? ? ??????????? BAH, HAK, and KAB have been constructed, equal to
??? ??? ???, ???, ???, ???? ???? ????? ??? ??? ??? solid angle at C, on the straight-line AB at the point A on
??? ?????? ?? ??? ???, ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???, it [Prop. 11.26], such that angle BAH is equal to ECF,
??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ? ?? and BAK to ECG, and KAH to GCF. And let it have
???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ?? ?? ? ?? ???? been contrived that as EC (is) to CG, so BA (is) to AK,
??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??. ??? ??? ???? ??? ????? and as GC (is) to CF, so KA (is) to AH [Prop. 6.12].
?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??. ??? ???- And thus, via equality, as EC is to CF, so BA (is) to AH
?????????? ?? ?? ???????????????? ??? ?? ?? ???????. [Prop. 5.22]. And let the parallelogram HB have been

???????? ?????, ?????? ??? ???? ?? ?? ???????????????? (thus) proportional, the parallelogram GE is thus simi?? ?? ???????????????. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ?? ??? ?? lar to the parallelogram KB. So, for the same (reasons),
???????????????? ?? ?? ??????????????? ?????? ???? the parallelogram KH is also similar to the parallelogram
??? ??? ?? ?? ?? ??? ???? ??? ??????????????? ??? ?? GF, and, further, FE (is similar) to HB. Thus, three
??????? ????? ????????????????? ??? ?? ??????? ????? of the parallelograms of solid CD are similar to three of

??? ?????, ?? ?? ???? ????? ???? ?????????? ??? ?? ???? ??? are equal and similar to the three opposite, and the (lat?????? ???? ??? ?? ?? ??????? ??? ?? ?? ?????? ?????? ter) three are equal and similar to the three opposite.

I say that the solid AB will

??? ??, ??, ?? ???? ???? ?? ???????? ?? ??????????? three parallelograms GE, AC, and CE, is also equal to
??? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ???, ???, ????? ?? ?????- the prism contained by the two triangles CFB and DEH,
??????????? ??? ??, ??, ??? ??? ??? ???? ???????? and the three parallelograms CH, BE, and CE. For they
??????????? ?? ?? ?????? ??? ?? ???????. ???? ???? ?? are contained by planes (which are) equal in number and
?? ??????? ???? ???????? ??? ??? ???? ????????? ???? in magnitude [Def. 11.10].‡ Thus, the whole of solid AB

thing it was required to show.

??, ??? ????? ? ?? ??????? ??? ??, ??? ???? ??? ? For since CH and CK are each parallelograms, CB
?? ?? ?? ????? ???. ????? ???????? ? ??? ????? ??? is equal to each of DH and EK [Prop. 1.34]. Hence,
? ?? ????? ?? ?? ????? ???. ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? DH is also equal to EK. Let EH have been subtracted
???????? ?? ??? ??????? ???? ?????, ?? ?? ?? ?????- from both. Thus, the remainder DE is equal to the re??????????? ?? ?? ???????????????. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? mainder HK. Hence, triangle DCE is also equal to tri?? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ??????? ???? ?????. ???? ?? ??? angle HBK [Props. 1.4, 1.8], and parallelogram DG to

?? ???????????? ??? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ???, ???, parallelogram CF is also equal to parallelogram BM,
????? ?? ???????????????? ??? ??, ??, ?? ???? ???? and CG to BN [Prop. 11.24]. For they are opposite.
?? ???????? ?? ??????????? ??? ??? ??? ???????? ??? Thus, the prism contained by the two triangles AFG and

CN.
Thus, parallelepiped solids (which are) on the same
base, and (have) the same height, and in which the (ends
of the straight-lines) standing up are not on the same
straight-lines, are equal to one another. (Which is) the

????? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??, ? ?? ?? ?? ??, ??? ?????? RW is thus equal and similar to parallelogram HL

????????????? ??? ?? ??????? ????? ????????????????? AM [Prop. 6.14]. So, for the same (reasons), LE is also

?????????? ? ?? ???? ?? ?, ??? ????????????? ?? ??, solid AE is equal to the whole parallelepiped solid XU
?? ??????. ???? ?? ???? ?? ?? ???????, ?? ????? ??? [Def. 11.10]. Let DR and WU have been drawn across,

????? ???? ??? ?? ?????, ????? ?? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ?? to CD, since (it is) also (equal) to AB. Parallelogram
???????. ??? ?? ???? ??, ???? ??????? ???????????????? Y T is thus also equal to CD. And DT is another (par?? ?? ??????? ?? ?? ???????? ????????? ???? ???? ???- allelogram). Thus, as base CD is to DT , so Y T (is) to
??????? ?????????, ????? ?? ? ?? ????? ???? ??? ?? ?????, DT [Prop. 5.7]. And since the parallelepiped solid CI
????? ?? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ??. ???? ?? ? ?? ????? has been cut by the plane RF, which is parallel to the
???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ?? opposite planes (of CI), as base CD is to base DT , so
?? ??????? ???? ?? ?? ???????, ????? ?? ?? ??????? solid CF (is) to solid RI [Prop. 11.25]. So, for the same

Y T (is) to DT . And, thus, as solid CF (is) to solid RI,
so solid Y X (is) to solid RI. Thus, solids CF and Y X
each have the same ratio to RI [Prop. 5.11]. Thus, solid
CF is equal to solid Y X [Prop. 5.9]. But, Y X was show

Thus, three par???????????? ??? ?? ??????? ??? ???? ??? ?????. ???? ?? allelograms of solid KP are equal and similar to three

???????? ?? ?? ????????????????, ??? ??? ?????? ??? are equal and similar to the three opposite (parallelo??? ??, ?? ????????????????, ????? ?? ??? ????? ?? grams) [Prop. 11.24]. Thus, the whole of solid KP is

????????? ??? ??, ?? ??????? ????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? Let parallelogram GK have been completed. And let the

?? ?? ???? ?? ??, ????? ?? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ?? And thus as parallelogram AG (is) to GK, so GK (is)

?? ???? ?? ??? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ?????, ???? ???? So let base EH not be equal to base NQ, but let EH

????? ?????? ??? ???? ??? ? ?? ??? ??. ?????? ??? ?? CM is also greater than AG. Therefore, let CT be made
?? ??? ? ??, ??? ????????????? ??? ?????? ??? ??? equal to AG. And let the parallelepiped solid V C have
??, ????? ?? ??? ??, ??????? ???????????????? ?? ??. been completed on the base NQ, with height CT . And
??? ???? ???? ???? ?? ?? ??????? ?? ?? ??????, ?????? ?? since solid AB is equal to solid CD, and CV (is) extrinsic
?? ??, ?? ?? ??? ???? ?? ???? ??? ????? ???? ?????, ????? (to them), and equal (magnitudes) have the same ratio to
??? ?? ?? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ?? ???????, ????? ?? ?? the same (magnitude) [Prop. 5.7], thus as solid AB is to
??????? ???? ?? ?? ???????. ???? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??????? solid CV , so solid CD (is) to solid CV . But, as solid AB
???? ?? ?? ???????, ????? ? ?? ????? ???? ??? ?? ?????? (is) to solid CV , so base EH (is) to base NQ. For the
?????? ??? ?? ??, ?? ??????? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??????? ???? solids AB and CV (are) of equal height [Prop. 11.32].
?? ?? ???????, ????? ? ?? ????? ???? ??? ?? ????? And as solid CD (is) to solid CV , so base MQ (is) to base

?? ?????, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??. ??? ?? ? ?? ?? ??? as base EH is to base NQ, so MC (is) to AG. And CT
??? ?? ??? ? ?? ????? ???? ??? ?? ?????, ????? ? ?? (is) equal to AG. And thus as base EH (is) to base NQ,
???? ??? ??. ??? ??, ?? ??? ??????? ???????????????? so MC (is) to AG. Thus, the bases of the parallelepiped
?????????????? ?? ?????? ???? ??????. solids AB and CD are reciprocally proportional to their
????? ?? ??? ??, ?? ??????? ???????????????? ????- heights.
???????????? ?? ?????? ???? ??????, ??? ???? ?? ? ?? So, again, let the bases of the parallelepipid solids AB
????? ???? ??? ?? ?????, ????? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ???? and CD be reciprocally proportional to their heights, and

??????? ?? ?? ??????. to the height of solid AB. I say that solid AB is equal to
???????? [???] ????? ?? ??????????? ???? ????? ???? solid CD. [For] let the (straight-lines) standing up again
???????. ??? ?? ??? ??? ????? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? ?????, ??? be at right-angles to the bases. And if base EH is equal
????? ?? ? ?? ????? ???? ??? ?? ?????, ????? ?? ??? to base NQ, and as base EH is to base NQ, so the height
?? ??????? ???? ???? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ????, ???? ??? of solid CD (is) to the height of solid AB, the height of
???? ??? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ????. solid CD is thus also equal to the height of solid AB.
?? ?? ??? ???? ?????? ?????? ??????????????? ??? ??? ?? And parallelepiped solids on equal bases, and also with

?? ?? ??????. Thus, solid AB is equal to solid CD.
?? ???? ?? ? ?? ????? ?? ?? [?????] ???, ???? ???? So, let base EH not be equal to [base] NQ, but let

?????? ?? ?? ??? ????? ? ??, ??? ????????????? ?????? (greater) than AG. Let CT again be made equal to AG,
?? ?? ???????. ???? ????? ?? ? ?? ????? ???? ??? ?? and let the solid CV have been similarly completed.
?????, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ??? ?? ? ?? ?? ??, Since as base EH is to base NQ, so MC (is) to AG,
462
STOIQEIWN iaþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 11
????? ??? ?? ? ?? ????? ???? ??? ?? ?????, ????? ? ?? and AG (is) equal to CT , thus as base EH (is) to base

???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ????? ?? ?? ?? ??????? ?? Since solid AB is equal to solid CD, but AB is equal

?? ?????, ????? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ???? ???? ?? ??? ?? of solid BT (see first part of proposition). And base FK
??????? ????. ?? ?? ???? ??? ???? ??? ??, ?? ??????? (is) equal to base EH, and base OR to NQ. Thus, as

463
STOIQEIWN iaþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 11
?????, ????? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ???? ???? ?? ??? ?? ???- the height of solid BT . And solids DX, BT are the same
???? ????. ??? ??, ?? ??? ??????? ???????????????? height as (solids) DC, BA (respectively). Thus, as base
?????????????? ?? ?????? ???? ??????. EH is to base NQ, so the height of solid DC (is) to the
????? ?? ??? ??, ?? ??????? ???????????????? ????- height of solid AB. Thus, the bases of the parallelepiped
???????????? ?? ?????? ???? ??????, ??? ???? ?? ? ?? solids AB and CD are reciprocally proportional to their
????? ???? ??? ?? ?????, ????? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ???? heights.
???? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ????? ????, ??? ???? ???? ?? ?? So, again, let the bases of the parallelepiped solids

????? ???? ??? ?? ?????, ????? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ???? solid CD (is) to the height of solid AB. I say that solid

?? ?????, ? ?? ?? ?? ??, ????? ??? ?? ? ?? ????? ???? For, with the same construction (as before), since as

† This proposition assumes that (a) if two parallelepipeds are equal, and have equal bases, then their heights are equal, and (b) if the bases of

??? ??? ??, ??, ??, ?? ??????? ??????? ?? ??, ??, ??, And let KC, NF, KB, and NE have been drawn from

??? ?? ???? ???? ???? ??? ??? ??, ??, ?? ?? ??? ??? ?? DF, AB, and DE. And let HC, CB, MF, and FE have
??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ??, ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???? been joined. Since the (square) on HA is equal to the
???? ???? ??? ??? ??, ??, ??. ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? (sum of the squares) on HK and KA [Prop. 1.47], and
???? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???? ???? the (sum of the squares) on KC and CA is equal to the

? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ???. ???? ?? ??? ? ??? ??? CA. And the (square) on HC is equal to the (sum of

?????? ???? ??????? ???? ?????? ???????? ??????? ??? ???? (square) on HA is equal to the (sum of the squares)
??????? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ???????????? ??? ???? ??? on HC and CA. Thus, angle HCA is a right-angle
???? ?????? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ??????? [Prop. 1.48]. So, for the same (reasons), angle DFM
???? ??????? ???????? ???? ???? ???????? ???????. ??? ??? is also a right-angle. Thus, angle ACH is equal to (an????? ? ?? ?? ??. ?????? ?? ????????, ??? ??? ? ?? ?? gle) DFM. And HAC is also equal to MDF. So, MDF
?? ????? ???. ???? ??? ??? ????? ? ??? ?? ?? ??, ? ?? and HAC are two triangles having two angles equal to

??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ???. ???? ?? ??? ???? ? ??? ??? [Prop. 1.26]. Thus, AC is equal to DF. So, similarly, we
???? ?? ??? ??? ???? ??? ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? can show that AB is also equal to DE. Therefore, since
??? ??? ????? ???. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ? ??? ??? ?? ??? AC is equal to DF, and AB to DE, so the two (straight??? ????? ???. ??? ?? ??????? ???? ?? ???, ??? [???] lines) CA and AB are equal to the two (straight-lines)
??? ?????? ???? ??????? ???? ?????? ???????? ??????? ??? FD and DE (respectively). But, angle CAB is also equal
???? ??????? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ???? ???? ????? ??????? to angle FDE. Thus, base BC is equal to base EF, and

???????? ???? ???????. ??? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??. ???? ?? angles to the remaining angles (respectively) [Prop. 1.4].
465
STOIQEIWN iaþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 11
??? ? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? ??, ?? Thus, angle ACB (is) equal to DFE. And the right-angle
???? ?????? ??? ????? ?????? ???????????. ????? ??? ? ?? ACK is also equal to the right-angle DFN. Thus, the
????? ?? ?? ??? ?????. ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, remainder BCK is equal to the remainder EFN. So,
???? ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??. ???? ?? ??? for the same (reasons), CBK is also equal to FEN.
??? ??? ?? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ??? ???? ??? ? ??? So, BCK and EFN are two triangles having two an???? ?? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, ??? ???? gles equal to two angles, respectively, and one side equal
??? ? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??? ???? ???? to one side—(namely), that by the equal angles—(that

??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? ???? ??? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? [Prop. 1.26]. Thus, CK is equal to FN. And AC (is) also
??, ?? ???? ????? ??????? ???????, ??? ????? ? ?? ????? equal to DF. So, the two (straight-lines) AC and CK are
?? ?? ??????? ???, ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? equal to the two (straight-lines) DF and FN (respec??? ????? ???. tively). And they enclose right-angles. Thus, base AK is
???? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ???????? ???? ??? ?? ???? ??? equal to base DN [Prop. 1.4]. And since AH is equal to
????????? [???? ???? ??????]. DM, the (square) on AH is also equal to the (square) on
DM. But, the the (sum of the squares) on AK and KH
is equal to the (square) on AH. For angle AKH (is) a
right-angle [Prop. 1.47]. And the (sum of the squares)
on DN and NM (is) equal to the square on DM. For angle DNM (is) a right-angle [Prop. 1.47]. Thus, the (sum
of the squares) on AK and KH is equal to the (sum of
the squares) on DN and NM, of which the (square) on
AK is equal to the (square) on DN. Thus, the remaining
(square) on KH is equal to the (square) on NM. Thus,
HK (is) equal to MN. And since the two (straight-lines)
HA and AK are equal to the two (straight-lines) MD
and DN, respectively, and base HK was shown (to be)
equal to base MN, angle HAK is thus equal to angle
MDN [Prop. 1.8].
Thus, if there are two equal plane angles, and so on
of the proposition. [(Which is) the very thing it was required to show].

????? ??? ?????? ???? ?? ?? ??????? ???????????????? For since the parallelepiped solid KA is similar to LC,
?? ??, ?? ?? ??? ???? ?? ?? ??????????? ????? ???? ???? KA thus has to LC the cubed ratio that AB (has) to CD
? ?? ???? ??? ??. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ?? ?? ???? ?? ?? [Prop. 11.33]. So, for the same (reasons), ME also has to

?????????? ????? ? ?? ?? ??, ?? ??????? ?????? ?? ??? since DO is parallel to PE, the alternate angles DOU and

????? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ????? ???, ??? ?? ??? ???????? ?? equal angles, base DU is thus equal to base UE, and tri??? ??????? ????? ???? ??? ?? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????? angle DOU is equal to triangle PUE, and the remaining
??????? ????? ??? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ?????. angles (are) equal to the remaining angles [Prop. 1.4].
??? ?? ????? ?????? ????? ? ???. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? Thus, angle OUD (is) equal to angle PUE. So, for this

????????, ??? ?? ??? ????? ??????? ???????, ? ????? ???? they will also have the remaining sides equal to the re??? ???????? ??? ? ??? ????? ????????? ???? ????????? maining sides [Prop. 1.26]. Thus, DT (is) equal to TG,

Thus, if the sides of the opposite planes of a cube are

???? ??????? ?? ??? ???? ?????? ??????? ???? ???????? For, if possible, let it be (in that ratio) to (some)

?? ??? ??? ??, ????? ? ???? ?????? ???? ?????? ?? ??? [is] to the (square) on DB, so area S (is) to circle ABCD

shown (to be) impossible. Thus, as the square on BD is
to the (square) on FH, so circle ABCD (is) not to some
area greater than circle EFGH. And it was shown that
neither (is it in that ratio) to (some) lesser (area). Thus,
as the square on BD is to the (square) on FH, so circle

475
STOIQEIWN ibþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 12
???????????????? ??? ???? ?? ????? ??? ??? ????? ? ?? EH is thus parallel to DB [Prop. 6.2]. So, for the same

???? ???? ??, ?? ???? ????? ??????? ???????? ??? ????? ? But, EB is equal to EA. Thus, AE is also equal to HK.

??? ?? ?? ???? ???????, ???? ?????? ???????????. ??? ??? is equiangular to triangle DHK [Prop. 1.29], and they

????, ???? ?? ???????? ?? ??????????? ??? ??? ??? And since BF is equal to FC, parallelogram EBFG
???????? ??? ???, ???, ????? ?? ???????????????? is double triangle GFC [Prop. 1.41]. And since, if two

aforementioned two prisms is greater than the (sum of
the) aforementioned two pyramids, whose bases (are) triangles AEG and HKL, and apexes the points H and D
(respectively).
Thus, the whole pyramid, whose base (is) triangle

pyramids (which are) equal to one another [and similar

????? ??? ??? ????? ? ??? ?? ?? ??, ? ?? ?? ?? ??, For since BO is equal to OC, and AL to LC, LO is

??????? ??? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ?????????? ??? ??? planes ABC and PMN they will be cut in the same ra??? ????????. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ? ??? ??? ? ??????? ??? tios [Prop. 11.17]. And GC was cut in half by the plane
?? ??? ???????? ???? ?????????? ??? ??? ??? ????????. PMN at N. Thus, the perpendicular from G to the plane

???????? ???? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ???, ??? ???????? for the same (reasons), the perpendicular from H to the

?? ??? ?? ????? ?? ? ??? ????? ???? ??? ??? ?????, For if base ABC is not to base DEF, as pyramid

???????? ??? ? ???? ??????? ?????? ??? ????????? ?? Let them have been left, and, for the sake of argument,

as base DEF (is) to base ABC, so pyramid DEFH (is)
to some (solid) less than pyramid ABCG [Prop. 5.11].
The very thing was shown (to be) absurd. Thus, base
ABC is not to base DEF, as pyramid ABCG (is) to
some solid greater than pyramid DEFH. And, it was
shown that neither (is it in this ratio) to a lesser (solid).
Thus, as base ABC is to base DEF, so pyramid ABCG

??????? ???? ??? ?????? ????????. ??? ??? ???? ??? ?? [Prop. 12.5]. But, as base ADE (is) to base ABCDE, so

????????????? ??? ?? ????, ???? ?????? ?????- For let the parallelepiped solids BGML and EHQP

?????, ? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???, ? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? DEF, and GBC to HEF, and ABG to DEH. And as AB
???, ??? ????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? is to DE, so BC (is) to EF, and BG to EH [Def. 11.9].
??? ??, ??? ? ?? ???? ??? ??. ??? ???? ????? ?? ? ?? And since as AB is to DE, so BC (is) to EF, and (so)
???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ??? ???? ???? ?????? the sides around equal angles are proportional, parallel?? ??????? ???????? ?????, ?????? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?????- ogram BM is thus similar to paralleleogram EQ. So,
??????????? ?? ?? ???????????????. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? for the same (reasons), BN is also similar to ER, and
?? ??? ?? ?? ?? ?????? ????, ?? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?? ???? BK to EO. Thus, the three (parallelograms) MB, BK,
??? ?? ??, ??, ?? ????? ???? ??, ??, ?? ????? ?????. and BN are similar to the three (parallelograms) EQ,
???? ?? ??? ???? ?? ??, ??, ?? ????? ???? ?????????? ??? EO, ER (respectively). But, the three (parallelograms)

?? ????? ?????? ??????????????? ?? ??????????? ???? ???? Thus, the solids BGML and EHQP are contained by

???? ??????? ??????????? ????? ???? ???? ? ???????? Thus, solid BGML is similar to solid EHQP [Def. 11.9].
?????? ? ?? ???? ??? ???????? ??????? ??? ??. ?? ?? ?? And similar parallelepiped solids are in the cubed ratio of

??????? ???? ??? ???? ????????, ????????? ? ??????? has to solid EHQP the cubed ratio that the correspond????? ????? ???? ??? ??????? ??? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ????? ing side BC (has) to the corresponding side EF. And as
?? ??? ??????? ???????????????? ?????????? ????? ??? ??- solid BGML (is) to solid EHQP, so pyramid ABCG (is)
???????. ??? ? ???? ??? ??????? ???? ??? ???? ??- to pyramid DEFH, inasmuch as the pyramid is the sixth
?????? ??????????? ????? ???? ???? ? ?? ???? ??? ??? part of the solid, on account of the prism, being half of the
???? ???? ??????. parallelepiped solid [Prop. 11.28], also being three times
the pyramid [Prop. 12.7]. Thus, pyramid ABCG also has
to pyramid DEFH the cubed ratio that BC (has) to EF.
(Which is) the very thing it was required to show.
Pìrisma. Corollary
??? ?? ?????? ???????, ??? ??? ?? ?????????? ????- So, from this, (it is) also clear that similar pyra??? ?????? ?????? ????????? ???? ??????? ?? ??????????? mids having polygonal bases (are) to one another as the

STOIQEIWN ibþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 12

????????? ??????? ?????? ???? ??? ?? ?? ????? ???????? pyramid having a triangular base in the latter (pyramid
????????? ????????? ?????? ???????, ????????? ???? ? having a polygonal base), so (the sum of) all the pyra????????? ????? ?????? ??????? ???? ??? ????????? mids having triangular bases in the former pyramid will

?????? ???? ??? ?????? ????? ??????? ??????????? ????? to the (latter) pyramid having a polygonal base. And a
???? ???? ? ?????? ???? ??? ???????. pyramid having a triangular base is to a (pyramid) having a triangular base in the cubed ratio of corresponding
sides [Prop. 12.8]. Thus, a (pyramid) having a polygonal
base also has to to a (pyramid) having a similar base the

??????, ??? ????? ?? ? ??? ????? ???? ??? ??? ?????, ABCG and DEFH are reciprocally proportional to their
????? ?? ??? ???? ????????? ???? ???? ?? ??? ???? heights, and (so) that as base ABC is to base DEF, so
????????? ????. the height of pyramid DEFH (is) to the height of pyra????????????? ??? ?? ????, ???? ?????? ?????- mid ABCG.
??????????. ??? ???? ??? ????? ? ???? ??????? ?? ???? For let the parallelepiped solids BGML and EHQP
????????, ??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ????????? ?????????? have been completed. And since pyramid ABCG is
?? ???? ???????, ??? ?? ???? ????????? ?????????? equal to pyramid DEFH, and solid BGML is six times
?? ???? ???????, ???? ??? ???? ?? ???? ??????? ?? pyramid ABCG (see previous proposition), and solid

485
STOIQEIWN ibþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 12
?????????????? ?? ?????? ???? ??????? ????? ??? ?? ? ?? thus equal to solid EHQP. And the bases of equal par????? ???? ??? ?? ?????, ????? ?? ??? ???? ??????? allelepiped solids are reciprocally proportional to their

????? ???? ??? ??, ????? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ?? ??? so the height of solid EHQP (is) to the height of solid
????????. ??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ?? ??? BGML. But, as base BM (is) to base EQ, so triangle
????????, ????? ?? ??? ???? ??????? ???? ???? ?? ??? ABC (is) to triangle DEF [Prop. 1.34]. And, thus, as
???? ??????? ????. ???? ?? ??? ??? ???? ??????? triangle ABC (is) to triangle DEF, so the height of solid
???? ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ???? ????????? ????, ?? ?? EHQP (is) to the height of solid BGML [Prop. 5.11].
??? ???? ??????? ???? ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ???? ??- But, the height of solid EHQP is the same as the height
??????? ????? ????? ??? ?? ? ??? ????? ???? ??? ??? of pyramid DEFH, and the height of solid BGML is
?????, ????? ?? ??? ???? ????????? ???? ???? ?? ??? the same as the height of pyramid ABCG. Thus, as base
???? ????????? ????. ??? ????, ???? ??? ????????? ABC is to base DEF, so the height of pyramid DEFH
?????????????? ?? ?????? ???? ??????. (is) to the height of pyramid ABCG. Thus, the bases
????? ?? ??? ????, ???? ????????? ????????????- of pyramids ABCG and DEFH are reciprocally propor???? ?? ?????? ???? ??????, ??? ???? ?? ? ??? ????? ???? tional to their heights.
??? ??? ?????, ????? ?? ??? ???? ????????? ???? ???? And so, let the bases of pyramids ABCG and DEFH

??????? ?? ???? ????????. let base ABC be to base DEF, as the height of pyramid
??? ??? ????? ????????????????, ???? ????? ?? ? DEFH (is) to the height of pyramid ABCG. I say that
??? ????? ???? ??? ??? ?????, ????? ?? ??? ???? ??- pyramid ABCG is equal to pyramid DEFH.
??????? ???? ???? ?? ??? ???? ????????? ????, ???? ?? For, with the same construction, since as base ABC
? ??? ????? ???? ??? ??? ?????, ????? ?? ?? ?????- is to base DEF, so the height of pyramid DEFH (is) to
??????????? ???? ?? ?? ????????????????, ??? ?? ??? the height of pyramid ABCG, but as base ABC (is) to
?? ?? ???????????????? ???? ?? ?? ????????????????, base DEF, so parallelogram BM (is) to parallelogram
????? ?? ??? ???? ????????? ???? ???? ?? ??? ???? EQ [Prop. 1.34], thus as parallelogram BM (is) to paral????????? ????. ???? ?? [???] ??? ???? ????????? ???? lelogram EQ, so the height of pyramid DEFH (is) also
?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ???? ???????????????? ????, ?? ?? to the height of pyramid ABCG [Prop. 5.11]. But, the
??? ???? ????????? ???? ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ???? height of pyramid DEFH is the same as the height of
???????????????? ????? ????? ??? ?? ? ?? ????? ???? parallelepiped EHQP, and the height of pyramid ABCG
??? ?? ?????, ????? ?? ??? ???? ???????????????? is the same as the height of parallelepiped BGML. Thus,
???? ???? ?? ??? ???? ???????????????? ????. ?? as base BM is to base EQ, so the height of parallelepiped
?? ??????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ?? ?????? EHQP (is) to the height of parallelepiped BGML. And
???? ??????, ??? ????? ??????? ???? ??? ???? ?? ???? those parallelepiped solids whose bases are reciprocally
??????? ???????????????? ?? ???? ?????? ?????????- proportional to their heights are equal [Prop. 11.34].
??????. ??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ????? ????? ? ???? Thus, the parallelepiped solid BGML is equal to the par???????, ??? ?? ???? ???????????????? ????? ????? ? allelepiped solid EHQP. And pyramid ABCG is a sixth
???? ???????? ??? ??? ? ???? ??????? ?? ???? ??- part of BGML, and pyramid DEFH a sixth part of par??????. allelepiped EHQP. Thus, pyramid ABCG is equal to
??? ??? ???? ????????? ??? ????????? ?????? ??????? pyramid DEFH.
?????????????? ?? ?????? ???? ??????? ??? ?? ????????? Thus, the bases of equal pyramids which also have

are equal. (Which is) the very thing it was required to

???????, ??? ?????????? ??? ??? ???? ?????? ????????- three times (the cone). And let the square ABCD have
?? ?? ????? ?? ?? ???? ?????????? ?????? ????? ? ?? been inscribed in circle ABCD [Prop. 4.6]. So, square
????? ??? ???? ??????. ??? ???????? ??? ??? ???? ??- ABCD is more than half of circle ABCD [Prop. 12.2].
???????? ?????? ??????? ?? ????????. ?? ?? ??????????? And let a prism of equal height to the cylinder have been

????? ???? ??? ???????????????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ????? square inscribed in circle ABCD is half of the circum?????????? ?????? ??????????????? ???????? ??????? ?? scribed (square). And the solids set up on them are par?? ??? ?? ???? ???? ???? ?????? ??????????????? ???? allelepiped prisms of equal height. And parallelepiped
?????? ????? ?? ?? ??????? ??? ?? ??? ??? ???? ??? ??- solids having the same height are to one another as their
???????? ????????? ?????? ????? ???? ??? ???????????? bases [Prop. 11.32]. And, thus, the prism set up on

??????????? ??? ????? ? ????????? ??????? ??? ????????? circumscribed about circle ABCD. And the cylinder is
??? ???????????? ??? ??? ???? ??? ???? ?????? ????- less than the prism set up on the square circumscribed

????? ? ?? ????? ??? ???? ??????. ??? ???????? ??? ??? the cone. Thus, inversely, the cone is greater than the

?????????? ????? ??? ???????????? ??? ??? ???? ??? square circumscribed about the circle [Prop. 12.2]. And
?????? ????????????? ??????????? ???? ?????? ??? ????? if we set up on the squares parallelepiped solids—which

????? ?? ???? ??????????, ????? ???? ??? ????????? ??? then the (prism) set up on square ABCD will be half

488
STOIQEIWN ibþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 12

circle ABCD. But, (it is) also less. For it is encompassed
by it. The very thing is impossible. Thus, the cylinder is
not less than three times the cone. And it was shown that
neither (is it) greater than three times (the cone). Thus,
the cylinder (is) three times the cone. Hence, the cone is
the third part of the cylinder.

has the same base as it, and an equal height. (Which is)
the very thing it was required to show.

?? ??? ??, ????? ?? ? ???? ?????? ???? ??? ???? For if not, then as circle ABCD (is) to circle EFGH,

?????????? ?? ????? ?? ??? ?????????? ?????? ????? and X. Let the square EFGH have been inscribed in cir? ?? ????? ??? ??????. ???????? ??? ??? ???? ??- cle EFGH [Prop. 4.6]. Thus, the square is greater than
???????? ??????? ??????? ?? ????? ? ??? ??????????? half of the circle [Prop. 12.2]. Let a pyramid of the same

???????????? ???? ??? ?????? ??????????, ??? ??? ????? Thus, the pyramid set up is greater than half of the cone,
??????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ????, ? ?????????? ??- inasmuch as, if we circumscribe a square about the cir????? ????? ???? ??? ?????????????? ???? ??????? ??? ????? cle [Prop. 4.7], and set up on it a pyramid of the same

??, ??, ??, ??, ??, ??, ??, ??. ??????? ??? ??? than the circumscribed pyramid. Let the circumferences

??? ???? ????? ???????? ??? ??????. ???????? ??? P, Q, R, and S. And let HP, PE, EQ, QF, FR, RG,
??????? ??? ???, ???, ???, ??? ???????? ??????? GS, and SH have been joined. Thus, each of the trian??????? ?? ????? ??? ?????? ??? ??? ???????????? ??- gles HPE, EQF, FRG, and GSH is greater than half
??????? ?????? ????? ? ?? ????? ??? ???? ?????? ???????? of the segment of the circle about it [Prop. 12.2]. Let

?? ? ???? ?????? ???? ??? ???? ??????, ????? ? ?? pyramid whose base is polygon HPEQFRGS, and apex
????? ???? ??????? ?? ??? ?? ????? ???????. ?????? the point N [Prop. 5.11]. Thus, alternately, as cone AL
?? ????????, ??? ???? ????? ?? ? ???? ?????? ???? ??? is to the pyramid within it, so solid O (is) to the pyramid
???? ??????, ????? ? ?? ????? ???? ??????? ?? ??? within cone EN [Prop. 5.16]. But, cone AL (is) greater
?? ????? ???????. than the pyramid within it. Thus, solid O (is) also greater
???? ??, ??? ???? ????? ?? ? ???? ?????? ???? ??? than the pyramid within cone EN [Prop. 5.14]. But, (it
???? ??????, ????? ? ?? ????? ???? ?????? ?? ??? ?? is) also less. The very thing (is) absurd. Thus, circle
????? ???????. ABCD is not to circle EFGH, as cone AL (is) to some
?? ??? ???????, ???? ???? ?????? ?? ?? ???????? ??? solid less than cone EN. So, similarly, we can show that
????? ?? ? ???? ?????? ???? ??? ???? ??????, ????? neither is circle EFGH to circle ABCD, as cone EN (is)

???? ??? ?? ?????, ????? ? ?? ????? ???? ??????? ?? So, I say that neither is circle ABCD to circle EFGH,

??? ???? ??????, ????? ? ?? ????? ???? ??????? ?? For, if possible, let it be (in this ratio) to (some)

????? ?? ? ???? ?????? ???? ??? ???? ??????, ????? ? circle ABCD, so solid O (is) to cone AL [Prop. 5.7 corr.].
?? ????? ???? ?????? ?? ??? ?? ????? ???????. ??????? But, as solid O (is) to cone AL, so cone EN (is) to some

???? ??? ???? ??????, ????? ? ?? ????? ???? ??? ?? circle EFGH (is) to circle ABCD, so cone EN (is) to
?????. some solid less than cone AL. The very thing was shown
????? ?? ? ????? ???? ??? ?????, ? ????????? ???? (to be) impossible. Thus, circle ABCD is not to circle

?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ???? ????? ????? ??? ????????? EFGH, so cone AL (is) to cone EN.
???? ???????? ????? ?? ?? ??????? ???? ???? ??????. But, as the cone (is) to the cone, (so) the cylinder (is) to the cylinder. For each (is) three times each
[Prop. 12.10]. Thus, circle ABCD (is) also to circle
EFGH, as (the ratio of the cylinders) on them (having)

Thus, cones and cylinders having the same height are

?????????, ?????? ?? ?? ?. ???? ??? ???????? ???? ????? is to solid O, so the pyramid whose base (is) [polygon]

??????????? ???? ???? ??? ?? ???? ?????? ?????????? ???? thing was shown (to be) impossible. Thus, cone ABCDL

the cubed ratio than BD (has) to FH. And it was shown
that neither (does it have such a ratio) to a lesser (solid).
Thus, cone ABCDL has to cone EFGHN the cubed ratio that BD (has) to FG.
And as the cone (is) to the cone, so the cylinder (is)
to the cylinder. For a cylinder is three times a cone on
the same base as the cone, and of the same height as it
[Prop. 12.10]. Thus, the cylinder also has to the cylinder
the cubed ratio that BD (has) to FH.
Thus, similar cones and cylinders are in the cubed ratio of the diameters of their bases. (Which is) the very

????, ??? ????? ?? ? ?? ????????? ???? ??? ?? ?????????, axis at point K. I say that as cylinder BG is to cylinder
????? ? ?? ???? ???? ??? ?? ?????. GD, so axis EK (is) to axis KF.
??????????? ??? ? ?? ???? ??? ??????? ?? ???? ??? For let axis EF have been produced in each direction
?? ?, ? ??????, ??? ??????????? ?? ?? ????? ???? ????- to points L and M. And let any number whatsoever (of
???????? ?? ??, ??, ?? ?? ?? ???? ???????????? ?? ??, lengths), EN and NL, equal to axis EK, be set out (on
??, ??? ??????? ? ??? ??? ?? ?????? ????????? ? ??, the axis EL), and any number whatsoever (of lengths),
?? ?????? ?? ??, ?? ??????. ??? ?????????? ??? ??? FO and OM, equal to (axis) FK, (on the axis KM).
?, ? ??????? ??????? ????????? ???? ??, ?? ??? ???? And let the cylinder PW, whose bases (are) the circles

??????? ???? ?? ?, ? ??????. ??? ???? ?? ??, ??, ?? let planes parallel to AB, CD, and the bases of cylinder

???? ???????? ????? ?? ?? ??????. ???? ?? ????? ?? ??????? let them have made the circles RS and TU around the
???? ??? ??? ?? ??, ??, ?? ????????? ????????. ???? ??? centers N and O (respectively). And since axes LN, NE,
?? ??, ??, ?? ?????? ???? ????? ????????, ???? ?? ??? ?? and EK are equal to one another, the cylinders QR, RB,
??, ??, ?? ????????? ???? ????????, ??? ????? ???? ?? and BG are to one another as their bases [Prop. 12.11].
?????? ?? ??????, ?????????? ??? ? ?? ???? ??? ?? But the bases are equal. Thus, the cylinders QR, RB,
??????, ?????????????? ????? ??? ? ?? ????????? ??? ?? and BG (are) also equal to one another. Therefore, since
?????????. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ?????????? ????? ? ?? ???? the axes LN, NE, and EK are equal to one another,
??? ?? ??????, ?????????????? ???? ??? ? ?? ????????? and the cylinders QR, RB, and BG are also equal to one
??? ?? ?????????. ??? ?? ??? ???? ????? ? ?? ???? ?? another, and the number (of the former) is equal to the
?? ?????, ???? ????? ??? ? ?? ????????? ?? ?? ????????, number (of the latter), thus as many multiples as axis KL

STOIQEIWN ibþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 12
?? ?? ?????? ? ???? ??? ??????, ?????? ??? ? ????????? is of axis EK, so many multiples is cylinder QG also of
??? ?????????, ??? ?? ???????, ???????. ???????? ?? ??- cylinder GB. And so, for the same (reasons), as many
????? ?????, ?????? ??? ??? ??, ??, ????????? ?? ??? multiples as axis MK is of axis KF, so many multiples
??, ??, ???????? ?????? ???????????, ??? ??? ?? ?????? is cylinder WG also of cylinder GD. And if axis KL is
??? ??? ?? ????????? ? ?? ?? ???? ??? ? ?? ?????????, equal to axis KM then cylinder QG will also be equal
??? ?? ?? ?????? ??? ??? ?? ????????? ? ?? ?? ???? to cylinder GW, and if the axis (is) greater than the axis
??? ? ?? ?????????, ??? ?????????, ??? ?? ???????? ? ?? then the cylinder (will also be) greater than the cylinder,
???? ??? ?? ??????, ???????? ??? ? ?? ????????? ??? and if (the axis is) less then (the cylinder will also be)
?? ?????????, ??? ?? ????, ????, ??? ?? ???????, ???????. less. So, there are four magnitudes—the axes EK and
????? ??? ?? ? ?? ???? ???? ??? ?? ?????, ????? ? ?? KF, and the cylinders BG and GD—and equal multiples
????????? ???? ??? ?? ?????????? ???? ???? ??????. have been taken of axis EK and cylinder BG—(namely),
axis LK and cylinder QG—and of axis KF and cylinder
GD—(namely), axis KM and cylinder GW. And it has
been shown that if axis KL exceeds axis KM then cylinder QG also exceeds cylinder GW, and if (the axes are)
equal then (the cylinders are) equal, and if (KL is) less
then (QG is) less. Thus, as axis EK is to axis KF, so
cylinder BG (is) to cylinder GD [Def. 5.5]. (Which is)

???????? ????. ?? ?? ??? ?? ???? ???? ????? ????? ??? For height LK is either equal to height MN, or not.

???? ??? ??? ?????????? ????????? ?????? ??? ??? ??????, circle on the surface of the sphere. And (it is) clear

??? ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? ??????? ??? ?? ? ?????????????? since PV and SW are each at right-angles to the plane

???????? ??????????? ??? ?? ??? ???????? ??? ?? ??????? the straight-line joining the points is in the same plane

?? ????? ?? ???? ????????????. Let the perpendicular (straight-line) AX have been

??, ?????? ??? ? ?? ??? ??. ??? ?? ? ?? ??????? ??? the plane at point X [Prop. 11.11]. And let XB and
??, ??? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??? ?? ?????? XK have been joined. And since AX is at right-angles to
?????. ??? ???? ?? ????? ???????????? ???? ?? ????, ??? the plane of quadrilateral KBPS, it is thus also at right???? ?? ??, ??, ??, ??? ??????? ? ??, ??? ?? ??? ??????? angles to all of the straight-lines joined to it which are
??? ?????? ????? ? ??, ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? also in the plane of the quadrilateral [Def. 11.3]. Thus,
?? ?????? ????? ? ?????????. ???? ??? ??? ? ??? ??? ?? AX is at right-angles to each of BX and XK. And since
??????? ? ??. ??? ???? ? ?? ??? ?? ??????? ????? ? AB is equal to AK, the (square) on AB is also equal to
?????, ??? ????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ?? ??? ??? the (square) on AK. And the (sum of the squares) on AX
??, ?? ???? ?? ??? [???] ??, ??, ????????????? ??? and XB is equal to the (square) on AB. For the angle
??? ?? ?????????? ??? ?????????????? ??? ??? ??? ?? at X (is) a right-angle [Prop. 1.47]. And the (sum of
???????????????? ??? ?? ??? ??, ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, the squares) on AX and XK is equal to the (square) on
?? ??????? ????? ? ?????????. ??? ???? ??? ?? ??????- AK [Prop. 1.47]. Thus, the (sum of the squares) on AX
???????? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ?? and XB is equal to the (sum of the squares) on AX and
??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? XK. Let the (square) on AX have been subtracted from
??? ??? ??? ?? ??????? ????? ? ?????????. ???? ?? ??? both. Thus, the remaining (square) on BX is equal to the
??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?????? ????? ? ?????????? ?????? remaining (square) on XK. Thus, BX (is) equal to XK.
??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??. ??? ???? ??? ????? ? So, similarly, we can show that the straight-lines joined

???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, ??, ?? ?? ??? Thus, a circle drawn (in the plane of the quadrilateral)
??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??, ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? with center X, and radius one of XB or XK, will also

??? ??? ??? ??. ?????? ??? ? ?? ??? ??? ????? ??? ? And since KB is greater than WV , and WV (is) equal

????????? ?????, ? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ????????? ??????? equal to each of KS and BP. Thus, KS and BP are
??????????? ???? ?? ????????? ?? ?????? ??? ????????? each greater than SP. And since quadrilateral KBPS
??????? ???? ??? ??????????. is in a circle, and KB, BP, and KS are equal (to one
??? ??? ??????? ???? ?? ???? ??????? ????? ??? ??? another), and PS (is) less (than them), and BX is the
??????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ??????????? ?? ????? radius of the circle, the (square) on KB is thus greater
??? ????????? ??????? ???? ??? ??????????? ???? ???? than double the (square) on BX.
† Let the perpendicular
???????. KY have been drawn from K to BV .
‡ And since BD is
less than double DY , and as BD is to DY , so the (rectangle contained) by DB and BY (is) to the (rectangle
contained) by DY and Y B—a square being described
on BY , and a (rectangular) parallelogram (with short
side equal to BY ) completed on Y D—the (rectangle contained) by DB and BY is thus also less than double the
(rectangle contained) by DY and Y B. And, KD being
joined, the (rectangle contained) by DB and BY is equal
to the (square) on BK, and the (rectangle contained) by
DY and Y B equal to the (square) on KY [Props. 3.31,
6.8 corr.]. Thus, the (square) on KB is less than double
the (square) on KY . But, the (square) on KB is greater
than double the (square) on BX. Thus, the (square) on
KY (is) greater than the (square) on BX. And since
BA is equal to KA, the (square) on BA is equal to the
(square) on AK. And the (sum of the squares) on BX
and XA is equal to the (square) on BA, and the (sum of
the squares) on KY and Y A (is) equal to the (square) on
KA [Prop. 1.47]. Thus, the (sum of the squares) on BX
and XA is equal to the (sum of the squares) on KY and
Y A, of which the (square) on KY (is) greater than the
(square) on BX. Thus, the remaining (square) on Y A
is less than the (square) on XA. Thus, AX (is) greater
than AY . Thus, AX is much greater than AG.
§ And AX
is (a perpendicular) on one of the bases of the polyhedron, and AG (is a perpendicular) on the surface of the
lesser sphere. Hence, the polyhedron will not touch the
lesser sphere on its surface.
Thus, there being two spheres about the same center, a polyhedral solid has been inscribed in the greater
sphere which does not touch the lesser sphere on its surface. (Which is) the very thing it was required to do.
† Since KB, BP, and KS are greater than the sides of an inscribed square, which are each of length ?
2 BX.
‡ Note that points Y and V are actually identical.
§ This conclusion depends on the fact that the chord of the polygon in proposition 12.16 does not touch the inner circle.

??????????? ??????? ?? ???, ???, ????????? ?? Let the spheres ABC and DEF have been conceived,

??????? ??????????? ????? ???? ???? ? ?? ???? ??? ??. I say that sphere ABC has to sphere DEF the cubed ratio

?????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ?????????? ?? the lesser sphere GHK on its surface [Prop. 12.17]. And
??? ?? ?? ??? ??????? ????????? ???? ?? ?? ?? ??? let a polyhedral solid, similar to the polyhedral solid in
??????? ????????? ??????????? ????? ???? ???? ? ?? ???? sphere DEF, have also been inscribed in sphere ABC.
??? ??. ???? ?? ??? ? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ??? ??????? Thus, the polyhedral solid in sphere ABC has to the
??????????? ????? ???? ? ?? ???? ??? ??? ????? ??? ?? polyhedral solid in sphere DEF the cubed ratio that BC
? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ??? ???????, ????? ?? ?? ?? (has) to EF [Prop. 12.17 corr.]. And sphere ABC also
??? ?????? ??????? ????????? ???? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?????? has to sphere GHK the cubed ratio that BC (has) to EF.
??????? ?????????? ??????? [???] ?? ? ??? ?????? ???? Thus, as sphere ABC is to sphere GHK, so the polyhe?? ?? ???? ?????????, ????? ? ??? ?????? ???? ?? ?? ?? dral solid in sphere ABC (is) to the polyhedral solid is

???????????? ??? ??? ?????. ??? ??? ? ??? ?????? ???? ABC (is) greater than the polyhedron within it. Thus,
???????? ??? ??? ??????? ??????????? ????? ???? ???? ? sphere GHK (is) also greater than the polyhedron within
?? ????????? ???? ??? ??. ?????? ?? ????????, ??? ???? ? sphere DEF [Prop. 5.14]. But, (it is) also less. For it is

?? ??? ???????, ????? ???? ??????? ??? ???? ???????? So, I say that sphere ABC does not have to some

?? ?? ? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ??? ???????, ????? ? ??? For, if possible, let it have (the cubed ratio) to a

?????? ????? ? ??? ??? ???, ?? ????????? ???????. ??? (has) to sphere ABC the cubed ratio that diameter
? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ???????? ???? ??? ??? ??????? EF (has) to diameter BC [Prop. 5.7 corr.]. And as
??????????? ????? ???? ???? ? ?? ???? ??? ??? ???? sphere LMN (is) to sphere ABC, so sphere DEF
???????? ???????. ??? ??? ? ??? ?????? ???? ??????? (is) to some (sphere) less than sphere ABC, inasmuch
???? ??? ??? ??????? ??????????? ????? ???? ???? ? ?? as LMN is greater than DEF, as was shown before

greater than sphere DEF the cubed ratio that BC (has)
to EF. And it was shown that neither (does it have

The Platonic Solids†
†The five regular solids—the cube, tetrahedron (i.e., pyramid), octahedron, icosahedron, and dodecahedron—were problably discovered by
the school of Pythagoras. They are generally termed “Platonic” solids because they feature prominently in Plato’s famous dialogue Timaeus. Many
of the theorems contained in this book—particularly those which pertain to the last two solids—are ascribed to Theaetetus of Athens.

??? ??? ??? ??, ???????????? ???? ?? ?? ??? ??. ??- across. And since the (square) on BA is five times the
?????????? ??? ? ??? ?????? ??? ??. ??? ???? ????? (square) on AC, AF is five times AH. Thus, gnomon
????? ? ?? ??? ??, ???????????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ?? ??? MNO (is) four times AH. And since DC is double CA,

?? ?? ??, ? ?? ?? ?? ??, [????? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? ??], Thus, gnomon MNO (is) equal to CG. And since DC is

??? ?? ?? ?? ?? ????? ????. ??? ???? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??? [Prop. 1.43]. Thus, KB (is) equal to LH plus HB. And
??? ???? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? the whole gnomon MNO was also shown (to be) equal

???? ??? ?????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ???????????? is to CB, so CB (is) to BD [Prop. 6.17]. And DC (is)
???????, ??? ????????? ??? ????????? ???????? ????? ??? greater than CB (see lemma). Thus, CB (is) also greater

507
STOIQEIWN igþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 13
???? ??? ?? ????? ???????? ???? ???? ??????. in extreme and mean ratio then the greater piece is CB.
Thus, if the square on a straight-line is five times
the (square) on a piece of itself, and double the aforementioned piece is cut in extreme and mean ratio, then
the greater piece is the remaining part of the original
straight-line. (Which is) the very thing it was required

case) the absurdity is much [greater].
Thus, double AC is greater than CB. (Which is) the

to BA, so BA (is) to AD [Prop. 6.17]. And DB (is)
greater than BA. Thus, BA (is) also greater than AD
[Prop. 5.14].
Thus, DB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at

þ. Proposition 6
???? ?????? ???? ????? ??? ????? ????? ?????, If a rational straight-line is cut in extreme and mean

D A G B D A B C
????? ?????? ???? ? ?? ??? ???????? ????? ??? ????? Let AB be a rational straight-line cut in extreme and

??????? ??? ??, ?? ?????? ????? ? ????????? ???????. that AC and CB is each that irrational (straight-line)
??????????? ??? ? ??, ??? ?????? ??? ?? ??????? called an apotome.
? ??. ???? ??? ?????? ? ?? ???????? ????? ??? ????? For let BA have been produced, and let AD be made
????? ???? ?? ?, ??? ?? ??????? ??????? ?? ?? ?????????? (equal) to half of BA. Therefore, since the straight? ?? ??????? ???? ??? ??, ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? line AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at C,
???????????? ?????. ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ?? ????? and AD, which is half of AB, has been added to the
????, ?? ??????? ???? ???????? ????????? ??? ?? ??? ?? greater piece AC, the (square) on CD is thus five times
?? ??? ??. ????? ?? ?? ??? ??? ???? ??? [?????] ? ?? the (square) on DA [Prop. 13.1]. Thus, the (square) on
??????? ???? ??? ?? ????? ?????? ????? ??? ??? ?? ??? CD has to the (square) on DA the ratio which a number
??? ???? ??? ???? ??? ? ??. ??? ???? ?? ??? ?? ???? (has) to a number. The (square) on CD (is) thus com?? ??? ?? ????? ??? ????, ?? ?????????? ??????? ???? mensurable with the (square) on DA [Prop. 10.6]. And
?????????? ???????, ?????????? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??? ?? the (square) on DA (is) rational. For DA [is] rational,
??, ?? ??? ????? ???? ??????? ????? ?????????? ??????? being half of AB, which is rational. Thus, the (square)
??? ????? ? ??. ?????, ???? ? ?? ????? ??? ????? ????? on CD (is) also rational [Def. 10.4]. Thus, CD is also
????????, ??? ?? ?????? ????? ????? ? ??, ?? ??? ??? ??, rational. And since the (square) on CD does not have
?? ?? ??? ?? ???? ?????. ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???????? to the (square) on DA the ratio which a square num???? ??? ?? ????? ?????????? ?????? ????? ??? ??. ?? ber (has) to a square number, CD (is) thus incommensu?? ??? ???????? ???? ????? ?????????????? ?????? ????? rable in length with DA [Prop. 10.9]. Thus, CD and DA
???????? ??????? ??????? ??? ????? ????? ? ??. ??????? are rational (straight-lines which are) commensurable in
?? ??? ? ?? ???????. square only. Thus, AC is an apotome [Prop. 10.73].
???? ??? ?????? ???? ????? ??? ????? ????? ?????, Again, since AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio,
???????? ??? ???????? ?????? ????? ? ????????? ???- and AC is the greater piece, the (rectangle contained) by
????? ???? ???? ??????. AB and BC is thus equal to the (square) on AC [Def. 6.3,
Prop. 6.17]. Thus, the (square) on the apotome AC, applied to the rational (straight-line) AB, makes BC as
width. And the (square) on an apotome, applied to a
rational (straight-line), makes a first apotome as width
[Prop. 10.97]. Thus, CB is a first apotome. And CA was
also shown (to be) an apotome.

Thus, if a rational straight-line is cut in extreme and
mean ratio then each of the pieces is that irrational
(straight-line) called an apotome.

??????? ????, ??? ?? ?????? ?????? ???? ??????? ??????? ???? BE, and triangle ABC equal to triangle ABE, and the
???????, ??? ?? ?? ???? ??????? ????????????, ? ??? ??? ??? remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles
?? ??? ???, ? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ???? ???? ??? ?????? which the equal sides subtend [Prop. 1.4], (that is), BCA

???? ?? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ???. ??? ?? ?? ??, ?? ???? ???? was also shown (to be) equal to the whole of BE. Thus,
??, ?? ???? ?????? ??? ????? ????? ????? ? ??? ????? ??? the remainder FC is also equal to the remainder FE.

? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ???? ??? ??? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? FC and CD are equal to the two (straight-lines) FE and

??????? ??? ?????. ?????? ?? ????????, ??? ??? ? ??? ??? was also shown (to be) equal to AEB. And thus the

????? ???. ??? ????? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ?? ??? ??? HE is also equal to (straight-line) EA—that is to say,

???????? ?? ??? ???????? ???????? ??? ????? ?? ? ?? [Prop. 1.5]. But, ABE was shown (to be) equal to BAH.

?????????? ????? ?? ?? ????? ???. ?????????? ?? ? ??? Since circumference ABCG is equal to circumference

????? ? ?? ??????. ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ???? FA is equal to FB, and FH is perpendicular (to AB),
?????. ??? ???? ????? ????? ? ?? ?????????? ??? ?? ????- angle AFK (is) thus also equal to KFB [Props. 1.5,

?? ??????????. ???? ? ?? ??? ?? ???? ?????, ???? ??? the decagon. So, for the same (reasons, circumference)
? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?????. ???? ??? ??? ? AK is also double KM. And since circumference AB

proportionally, as straight-line BA is to AK, so KA (is) to

side of the pentagon, and BF (the side) of the hexagon

????? ? ?? ???? ??? ???????? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???????? (we can take) the doubles of the leading (magnitudes).
?? ??????? ?? ??? ? ??? ?? ????? ???? ??? ???????? ??? Thus, as double LC (is) to CA, so double MF (is) to

??? ?? ????? ? ??, ??? ?? ?? ??????? ? ??, ??? ?? ?? FA. And, thus, as double LC (is) to CA, so MF (is) to
???????? ????? ? ??? ????? ??? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, half of FA. And (we can take) the halves of the following
????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??. ???????? ??? ?? ???????????? (magnitudes). Thus, as double LC (is) to half of CA, so
? ??? ???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??? ?? ??? ?? MF (is) to the fourth of FA. And DC is double LC, and

??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??. ???????????? ?? ?? ??? ??? the (square) on MK was shown (to be) to the (square)
?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???????????? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? on KF. Thus, the (square) on MK (is) five times the
??? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ?? (square) on KF. And the square on KF (is) rational.
????? ??? ????, ?? ?????????? ??????? ???? ?????????? For the diameter (is) rational. Thus, the (square) on
???????? ?????????? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ?? ?????. ??? ???? MK (is) also rational. Thus, MK is rational [in square
???? ??????? ?????. ?? ??, ?? ??? ????? ???? ??????? only]. And since BF is four times FK, BK is thus five
????? ?????????. ??? ?? ??? ????? ???? ???????? ??????? times KF. Thus, the (square) on BK (is) twenty-five
????? ????????? ???? ?? ???, ? ????? ?????? ????? ???- times the (square) on KF. And the (square) on MK
????? ??????? ??? ????? ? ??, ????????????? ?? ???? ? (is) five times the square on KF. Thus, the (square)
??. ???? ??, ??? ??? ???????. ? ?? ?????? ???? ?? ??? on BK (is) five times the (square) on KM. Thus, the

??. ???? ? ?? ?? ?? ????????? ?????? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? [Prop. 10.9]. And each of them is a rational (straight?? ????????? ?????. ??? ???? ???????????? ???? ?? ??? line). Thus, BK and KM are rational (straight-lines
??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? which are) commensurable in square only. And if from

?, ??? ?? ?????????? ???? ??????????? ?????????? ??? whole, then the remainder is that irrational (straight-line
????? ? ?? ?? ?? ? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? called) an apotome [Prop. 10.73]. Thus, MB is an apo?????????? ?????. ???? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? ?????????????? tome, and MK its attachment. So, I say that (it is) also
??? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ??? ?????????? ?????, ??? ??? a fourth (apotome). So, let the (square) on N be (made)
? ?? ????????? ???? ?? ????????? ???? ?? ??, ??????? equal to that (magnitude) by which the (square) on BK
??? ??????? ????? ? ??. ?? ?? ??? ????? ??? ???????? is greater than the (square) on KM. Thus, the square on
???????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????? ?????, ??? ? ??- BK is greater than the (square) on KM by the (square)
?????? ???? ?????? ?????, ???????? ?? ???????. ??????? on N. And since KF is commensurable (in length) with
?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????????????? ??? ?? FB then, via composition, KB is also commensurable (in
????????? ???????? ?? ??? ???????? ?? ??? ??????? length) with FB [Prop. 10.15]. But, BF is commensu??? ????? ?? ??? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ??? ?? ???? ??? rable (in length) with BH. Thus, BK is also commen??. surable (in length) with BH [Prop. 10.12]. And since
?? ??? ?? ??? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ????? ? ??- the (square) on BK is five times the (square) on KM,
??????? ???????? ???? ???? ??????. the (square) on BK thus has to the (square) on KM the
ratio which 5 (has) to one. Thus, via conversion, the
(square) on BK has to the (square) on N the ratio which
5 (has) to 4 [Prop. 5.19 corr.], which is not (that) of a
square (number) to a square (number). BK is thus incommensurable (in length) with N [Prop. 10.9]. Thus,
the square on BK is greater than the (square) on KM
by the (square) on (some straight-line which is) incommensurable (in length) with (BK). Therefore, since the
square on the whole, BK, is greater than the (square) on
the attachment, KM, by the (square) on (some straightline which is) incommensurable (in length) with (BK),
and the whole, BK, is commensurable (in length) with
the (previously) laid down rational (straight-line) BH,
MB is thus a fourth apotome [Def. 10.14]. And the
rectangle contained by a rational (straight-line) and a
fourth apotome is irrational, and its square-root is that
irrational (straight-line) called minor [Prop. 10.94]. And
the square on AB is the rectangle contained by HBM,
on account of joining AH, (so that) triangle ABH becomes equiangular with triangle ABM [Prop. 6.8], and
(proportionally) as HB is to BA, so AB (is) to BM.
Thus, the side AB of the pentagon is that irrational
(straight-line) called minor.†

And as BA (is) to AC, so the (square) on BA (is) to the
(square) on AD [inasmuch as if DB is joined then as BA
is to AD, so DA (is) to AC, on account of the similarity
of triangles DAB and DAC. And as the first is to the
third (of four proportional magnitudes), so the (square)
on the first (is) to the (square) on the second.] Thus,
the (square) on BA (is) also one and a half times the
(square) on AD. And BA is the diameter of the given
sphere, and AD (is) equal to the side of the pyramid.
Thus, the square on the diameter of the sphere is one

If the radius of the sphere is unity then the side of the pyramid (i.e., tetrahedron) is p

????????????? ??? ?? ??, ??. ??? ???? ???? ????? For let KG and EG have been joined. And since an? ??? ??? ????? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ????? ????? ???? gle KEG is a right-angle—on account of KE also being
?? ?? ???????? ?????? ??? ???? ??? ?? ???????, ?? ??? at right-angles to the plane EG, and manifestly also to
??? ??? ?? ?????????? ?????????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ? the straight-line EG [Def. 11.3]—the semi-circle drawn
???????. ?????, ???? ? ?? ???? ???? ???? ???????? ??? ??, on KG will thus also pass through point E. Again, since
??, ??? ???? ?? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ????? ? ??? ???? GF is at right-angles to each of FL and FE, GF is thus
??? ??? ??????????? ??? ??, ? ?? ???? ????? ??? ???? also at right-angles to the plane FK [Prop. 11.4]. Hence,
??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ????? ?? ??? ??? ?? ?????????? if we also join FK then GF will also be at right-angles
?????????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ?. ?????? ??? ??? ??? ?????? to FK. And, again, on account of this, the semi-circle
??? ????? ??????? ????. ??? ?? ???????? ??? ?? ??- drawn on GK will also pass through point F. Similarly,
????????? ?? ?????????? ??? ?? ???? ????????????, ???? it will also pass through the remaining (angular) points of
?????? ????????, ????? ?????? ?????????????? ? ?????. the cube. So, if KG remains (fixed), and the semi-circle is
???? ??, ??? ??? ?? ???????. ???? ??? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? carried around, and again established at the same (posi??, ??? ????? ???? ? ???? ?? ? ?????, ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? tion) from which it began to be moved, then the cube will
????????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??. ??? ?? ? ?? ?? ??? ?? ??? have been enclosed by a sphere. So, I say that (it is) also
??? ??? ?? ????????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ?? ??? (enclosed) by the given (sphere). For since GF is equal
??? ??, ??, ???????? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?????????? ???? ??? to FE, and the angle at F is a right-angle, the (square)
??? ??? ??. ??? ???? ?????????? ????? ? ?? ??? ??, ?? on EG is thus double the (square) on EF [Prop. 1.47].
?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? And EF (is) equal to EK. Thus, the (square) on EG
??? ??, ?????????? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??. is double the (square) on EK. Hence, the (sum of the
??????? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??????????. squares) on GE and EK—that is to say, the (square) on
??? ?????? ??? ? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? GK [Prop. 1.47]—is three times the (square) on EK.
????? ? ?? ??? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ??? ? ?? ??? And since AB is three times BC, and as AB (is) to
??? ???? ?? ??? ???????? ??????? ????????. BC, so the (square) on AB (is) to the (square) on BD
?? ??????? ??? ?????? ???????????? ? ?????? ??? ??- [Prop. 6.8, Def. 5.9], the (square) on AB (is) thus three
?????????????, ??? ? ??? ??????? ????????? ??????? ???- times the (square) on BD. And the (square) on GK was
??????? ???? ??? ??? ????? ???????? ???? ???? ??????. also shown (to be) three times the (square) on KE. And
KE was made equal to DB. Thus, KG (is) also equal to
AB. And AB is the radius of the given sphere. Thus, KG
is also equal to the diameter of the given sphere.
Thus, the cube has been enclosed by the given sphere.
And it has simultaneously been shown that the square on

STOIQEIWN igþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 13
??? ??????????? ??? ??, ??, ???? ??? ?????????? ????- And EV (is the side) of a hexagon. Thus, QW (is) also

??? ????? ?? ??, ??, ??, ?? ???????, ?????? ?? ?? ? as, if we join V K and WU then they will be equal and

?? ??? ????? ??? ????? ????? ???????? ???? ?? ?, ??? ?? of a pentagon. And LM is also (the side) of a pentagon.

? ?? ???? ??? ??. ??? ??? ????? ????? ??? ??????????? For, since V W is (the side) of a hexagon, and WZ

???????? ??? ?? ??????????? ?? ?????????? ??? ?? ???? [Prop. 13.9]. Thus, as ZV is to V W, so V W (is) to WZ.
????? ????????????, ???? ?????? ????????, ???? ??? ??? And V W (is) equal to V E, and WZ to V X. Thus, as

?? ???????. ???????? ??? ? ?? ???? ???? ?? ?. ??? ???? then angle XEZ will be a right-angle, on account of the
?????? ?????? ? ?? ????? ??? ????? ????? ???????? ???? similarity of triangles XEZ and V EZ. [Prop. 6.8]. So,
?? ?, ??? ?? ??????? ????? ????? ????? ? ??, ? ??? ?? for the same (reasons), since as ZV is to V W, so V W
??????????? ??? ???????? ??? ???????? ???????? ??? ?? (is) to WZ, and ZV (is) equal to XW, and V W to WQ,
???????????? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ???????? thus as XW is to WQ, so QW (is) to WZ. And, again,
????????? ???????????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? on account of this, if we join QX then the angle at Q will

STOIQEIWN igþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 13
??? ??????? ??? ????? ??? ???? ?? ?? ??? ??????? ??? closed by a sphere. So, I say that (it is) also (enclosed)
????? ??????? ??? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? ????? ? ?? by the given (sphere). For let V W have been cut in half
? ??? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ??? ? ?? ??? ??? ???? at a. And since the straight-line V Z has been cut in ex?? ??? ???????? ??????? ????????? ?? ??? ??????? ?????? treme and mean ratio at W, and ZW is its lesser piece,
???????????? ?? ???????????. then the square on ZW added to half of the greater piece,
???? ??, ??? ? ??? ??????????? ?????? ?????? ????? ? Wa, is five times the (square) on half of the greater piece
????????? ???????. ???? ??? ???? ????? ? ??? ??????? [Prop. 13.3]. Thus, the (square) on Za is five times the
?????????, ??? ???? ??????? ???????????? ??? ?? ??? (square) on aW. And ZX is double Za, and V W double
??????? ??? ????? ??????, ???? ??? ???? ??? ? ?? aW. Thus, the (square) on ZX is five times the (square)
??? ??????? ??? ????? ??????? ???? ??? ? ????????? on WV . And since AC is four times CB, AB is thus
????? ???? ?????. ??? ?? ??? ?????? ????? ?????? ??? five times BC. And as AB (is) to BC, so the (square)
????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????, ? ??? ???- on AB (is) to the (square) on BD [Prop. 6.8, Def. 5.9].
??????? ?????? ?????? ????? ? ????????? ???????. ? ?? Thus, the (square) on AB is five times the (square) on
??? ????? ?????????? ?????? ? ??? ??????????? ?????. BD. And the (square) on ZX was also shown (to be)
? ??? ??? ??????????? ?????? ?????? ????? ? ????????? five times the (square) on V W. And DB is equal to V W.
???????. For each of them is equal to the radius of circle EFGHK.
Thus, AB (is) also equal to XZ. And AB is the diameter
of the given sphere. Thus, XZ is equal to the diameter
of the given sphere. Thus, the icosahedron has been enclosed by the given sphere.
So, I say that the side of the icosahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called minor. For since the diameter
of the sphere is rational, and the square on it is five times
the (square) on the radius of circle EFGHK, the radius
of circle EFGHK is thus also rational. Hence, its diameter is also rational. And if an equilateral pentagon
is inscribed in a circle having a rational diameter then
the side of the pentagon is that irrational (straight-line)
called minor [Prop. 13.11]. And the side of pentagon
EFGHK is (the side) of the icosahedron. Thus, the side
of the icosahedron is that irrational (straight-line) called
minor.

???? ??? ??, ????? ? ?? ???? ??? ??], ? ?? ??? ????? sides will be straight-on (to one another) [Prop. 6.32].
??? ????? ????? ???????? ???? ?? ?, ??? ?? ?????? ????? Thus, XH is straight-on to HW. And every straight-line
????? ? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????????? ???? ??? is in one plane [Prop. 11.1]. Thus, pentagon UBWCV is
??? ??? ??. ??? ?? ? ??? ?? ?? ??, ? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?? in one plane.
??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????????? ????????? ???? ??? ??? So, I say that it is also equiangular.
??? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ??, ?? ??????????? ???? For since the straight-line NP has been cut in extreme
??? ??? ??? ??. ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? and mean ratio at R, and PR is the greater piece [thus as
??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ??, ???????? ?? ??? ??? ?? the sum of NP and PR is to PN, so NP (is) to PR], and
[???? ??? ? ??? ??? ?????], ???????????? ???? ??? ??? PR (is) equal to PS [thus as SN is to NP, so NP (is) to
??? ??? ????? ??? ????? ? ?? ??? ??. ???? ?? ??? ? ?? PS], NS has thus also been cut in extreme and mean
??? ?? ?????? ??? ??? ????? ? ?? ?? ??. ??? ???? ??? ?? ratio at P, and NP is the greater piece [Prop. 13.5].
??, ?? ???? ???? ??, ?? ???? ?????, ??? ????? ? ?? ????? Thus, the (sum of the squares) on NS and SP is three
?? ?? ???, ????? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ????? times the (square) on NP [Prop. 13.4]. And NP (is)
???. ?????? ?? ????????, ??? ??? ? ??? ??? ????? ??? ???? equal to NB, and PS to SV . Thus, the (sum of the)
?? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ???, ???, ??? ????? ?????? squares on NS and SV is three times the (square) on
???? ???????? ?????. ??? ?? ?????????? ?????????? ?? ????? NB. Hence, the (sum of the squares) on V S, SN, and
?????? ???? ???????? ????, ????????? ????? ?? ??????????? NB is four times the (square) on NB. And the (square)
????????? ??? ???? ?? ????? ??????????. ??????? ?? ??? on SB is equal to the (sum of the squares) on SN and
??????????? ?? ??? ????? ?????????? ?????????? ???? NB [Prop. 1.47]. Thus, the (sum of the squares) on BS
??? ?????????, ??? ????? ??? ???? ??? ????? ??????? ??? and SV —that is to say, the (square) on BV [for angle
??. ??? ??? ??? ??????? ??? ??? ????? ?????? ??????? V SB (is) a right-angle]—is four times the (square) on
?? ???? ??????????????, ???????????? ?? ????? ??????? NB [Def. 11.3, Prop. 1.47]. Thus, V B is double BN.
??? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ?? ??? ????????? ??- And BC (is) also double BN. Thus, BV is equal to BC.
??????????, ? ???????? ???????????. And since the two (straight-lines) BU and UV are equal
??? ?? ???? ??? ?????? ?????????? ?? ??????? ??? ??????, to the two (straight-lines) BW and WC (respectively),
??? ? ??? ??????????? ?????? ?????? ????? ? ????????? and the base BV (is) equal to the base BC, angle BUV

??????????? ??? ? ??, ??? ???? ? ??? ????????? ??? can show that angle UV C is equal to angle BWC. Thus,
? ?? ?? ??? ????? ????????, ??? ???? ????????? ???????? the three angles BWC, BUV , and UV C are equal to one
????? ??? ????????? ?? ?? ??????????? ????????? ??? another. And if three angles of an equilateral pentagon
????????? ???????. ?????????? ???? ?? ?? ?? ? ??? are equal to one another then the pentagon is equiangu??????? ???? ??? ??????? ??? ??????????????? ??? ?????, lar [Prop. 13.7]. Thus, pentagon BUV CW is equiangu??? ? ?? ??????? ??? ??????? ??? ?????. ????????? ?? ? lar. And it was also shown (to be) equilateral. Thus, pen??. ??? ???? ?????? ?????? ? ?? ????? ??? ????? ????? tagon BUV CW is equilateral and equiangular, and it is
???????? ???? ?? ?, ??? ?? ?????? ????? ????? ????? ? ??, on one of the sides, BC, of the cube. Thus, if we make the
532
STOIQEIWN igþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 13
?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??. same construction on each of the twelve sides of the cube
??? ?? ? ??? ?? ?? ??, ????????? ??? ? ??? ?? ?? ?? then some solid figure contained by twelve equilateral
????? ???, ? ?? ?? ?? ??. ???? ??? ??? ? ?? ?? ??, ???? and equiangular pentagons will have been constructed,
??? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ?? ????????? ???? ??? ??? which is called a dodecahedron.
??? ??. ???? ?? ??? ??? ??, ?? ???? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??? So, it is necessary to enclose it in the given sphere,
?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?????????? ???? ??? ??? ??? ??. ???? and to show that the side of the dodecahedron is that
?? ??? ? ?? ??? ??????? ??? ??????? ??? ??????????????? irrational (straight-line) called an apotome.
??? ????? ??????? ?????????? ??? ???????? ??? ??? ????? For let XP have been produced, and let (the produced
???????? ???????????? ??? ????? ??????????? ??? ?????? straight-line) be XZ. Thus, PZ meets the diameter of the
?????????? ??? ??????, ??? ? ??? ??????? ????????? ??????? cube, and they cut one another in half. For, this has been
?????????? ???? ??? ??????? ??? ?????. ?? ?? ??? ??? ????, proved in the penultimate theorem of the eleventh book
??? [?] ??????? ??? ????????? ??? ????? ? ?? ??????? ??? ??? [Prop. 11.38]. Let them cut (one another) at Z. Thus,
????? ???????? ? ??? ?? ??? ???? ?? ?? ??? ??????? ??? Z is the center of the sphere enclosing the cube, and ZP
??????? ??? ??????????????? ??? ?????. ??? ???? ?? ? (is) half the side of the cube. So, let UZ have been joined.
??????? ??? ??????? ??? ??????????????? ??? ?????? ?? And since the straight-line NS has been cut in extreme
? ??? ??????? ???? ?? ????????? ???? ??? ???????. ?????? and mean ratio at P, and its greater piece is NP, the
?? ????????, ??? ??? ?????? ??? ?????? ?????? ??? ??- (sum of the squares) on NS and SP is thus three times
????????? ???? ?? ????????? ???? ??? ???????? ???????????? the (square) on NP [Prop. 13.4]. And NS (is) equal to
??? ?? ??????????? ?? ??????? ??????. XZ, inasmuch as NP is also equal to PZ, and XP to
???? ??, ??? ? ??? ??????????? ?????? ?????? ????? PS. But, indeed, PS (is) also (equal) to XU, since (it
? ????????? ???????. is) also (equal) to RP. Thus, the (sum of the squares)
????? ??? ??? ?? ????? ??? ????? ????? ?????????? ?? on ZX and XU is three times the (square) on NP. And
?????? ????? ????? ? ??, ??? ?? ?? ????? ??? ????? ????? the (square) on UZ is equal to the (sum of the squares)
?????????? ?? ?????? ????? ????? ? ??, ???? ??? ??? ?? on ZX and XU [Prop. 1.47]. Thus, the (square) on UZ
????? ??? ????? ????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ????? ????? ? is three times the (square) on NP. And the square on
??. [???? ???? ????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ? ?? ???? ??? the radius of the sphere enclosing the cube is also three
??, ??? ?? ????????? ?? ??? ???? ???? ?????? ????????????? times the (square) on half the side of the cube. For it
??? ????? ???? ?????? ?? ??? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ? has previously been demonstrated (how to) construct the
?? ???? ???????????? ??? ??, ??. ?????? ?? ? ?? ??? cube, and to enclose (it) in a sphere, and to show that
??? ?????? ??? ??? ? ?? ???????????? ??? ??, ??? ? ?? the square on the diameter of the sphere is three times
??? ????? ??? ????? ????? ????????, ??? ?? ?????? ????? the (square) on the side of the cube [Prop. 13.15]. And
????? ????? ? ??.] ??? ?? ? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ????? if the (square on the) whole (is three times) the (square
??? ????? ????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ????? ????? ? ??. on the) whole, then the (square on the) half (is) also
??? ???? ???? ????? ??? ??????? ????????? ??? ???? ??????? (three times) the (square on the) half. And NP is half
?????????? ??? ??? ????? ???????, ???? ??? ????? ? ?? of the side of the cube. Thus, UZ is equal to the radius
?????? ???? ??? ?????. ??? ?? ???? ?????? ????? ??? of the sphere enclosing the cube. And Z is the center of
????? ????? ?????, ???????? ??? ???????? ?????? ????? the sphere enclosing the cube. Thus, point U is on the
???????. surface of the sphere. So, similarly, we can show that
?? ?? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ??????????? ?????? ????? each of the remaining angles of the dodecahedron is also
???????. on the surface of the sphere. Thus, the dodecahedron has
been enclosed by the given sphere.
So, I say that the side of the dodecahedron is that
irrational straight-line called an apotome.
For since RP is the greater piece of NP, which has
been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and PS is the
greater piece of PO, which has been cut in extreme and
mean ratio, RS is thus the greater piece of the whole
of NO, which has been cut in extreme and mean ratio.
[Thus, since as NP is to PR, (so) PR (is) to RN, and
(the same is also true) of the doubles. For parts have the
same ratio as similar multiples (taken in corresponding
533
STOIQEIWN igþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 13
order) [Prop. 5.15]. Thus, as NO (is) to RS, so RS (is)
to the sum of NR and SO. And NO (is) greater than
RS. Thus, RS (is) also greater than the sum of NR and
SO [Prop. 5.14]. Thus, NO has been cut in extreme and
mean ratio, and RS is its greater piece.] And RS (is)
equal to UV . Thus, UV is the greater piece of NO, which
has been cut in extreme and mean ratio. And since the
diameter of the sphere is rational, and the square on it
is three times the (square) on the side of the cube, NO,
which is the side of the cube, is thus rational. And if
a rational (straight)-line is cut in extreme and mean ratio then each of the pieces is the irrational (straight-line
called) an apotome.
Thus, UV , which is the side of the dodecahedron,
is the irrational (straight-line called) an apotome [Prop.
13.6].

534
STOIQEIWN igþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 13
???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ????????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ???????? times AD. And as BA (is) to AD, so the (square) on

??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??. ???? ?? ??? ? ??? ??????? Again, since AD is double DB, AB is thus triple BD.

????????? ??? ??? ????????? ???????. ??? ????? ? ?? ? And since AC is equal to CB, AB is thus double BC.

??? ? ?? ??? ??. ???????????? ??? ???? ?? ??? ??? ?? So let AG have been drawn from point A at right??? ??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??, ??, ???? ???? ?? angles to the straight-line AB. And let AG be made equal

?? ??? ?? ???? ?????, ????? ??? ? ?? ?????? ??? ?? to AC, so HK (is) to KC [Prop. 6.4]. HK (is) thus also

535
STOIQEIWN igþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 13
?? ? ??? ??? ??? ???? ?? ??, ???? ??? ?? ??? ???? ??? which the icosahedron has been described. Thus, KL is
????????? ??? ??? ???????? ??? ????? ??????? ??? ??, (the side) of the hexagon (inscribed) in the aforemen?? ????????? ??? ??? ?????????? ??? ????? ? ??. ? ?? tioned circle [Prop. 4.15 corr.]. And since the diameter of

????? ? ??. two of (the sides) of the decagon, inscribed in the afore??? ???? ? ?? ????? ???? ??????, ???????? ????? ??? mentioned circle, and AB is the diameter of the sphere,

????????? ??? ?? ??????? ?????????, ??? ?? ??? ????? ??? And ML (is the side) of the hexagon—for (it is) equal to

????? ?????????, ??? ?? ??? ????? ??????? ?????, ? ?? ??? pentagon is (the side) of the icosahedron [Prop. 13.16].
????????? ??? ??? ????? ??????? ???????. ?? ??? ??? Thus, MB is (the side) of the icosahedron.
????????? ??? ????? ???????? ???????, ???? ?? ????????? And since FB is the side of the cube, let it have been

??? ? ??? ???????????, ???? ???? ??????? ???? ???? ??? [Prop. 13.17 corr.].
???????????? ????? ?? ?????? ??????? ?????? ??? ?????, ? ??? And since the (square) on the diameter of the sphere
???????, ? ?? ???????. was shown (to be) one and a half times the square on the

????? ??? ????????? ???? ?? ??? ???????? ?? ??? on (the side), FB, of the cube, thus, of whatever (parts)
???????, ???????? ????? ?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? the (square) on the diameter of the sphere (makes) six,
? ?? ???? ??? ??. ??? ???? ????? ??????? ???????? ?????, of such (parts) the (square) on (the side) of the pyramid

????? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ???????? ??? two. Thus, the (square) on the side of the pyramid is one
?? ? ?? ???? ??? ??, ????? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? and a third times the square on the side of the octagon,
??? ??. ?????? ?? ? ?? ??? ??? ?????????? ??? ?? ??? and double the square on (the side) of the cube. And the
??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??. ???? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? (square) on (the side) of the octahedron is one and a half
??? ??? ?? ????????????? ????? ??? ? ?? ??? ??? ?????? times the square on (the side) of the cube. Therefore,
??? ?? ??? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ??? ? ?? ??? the aforementioned sides of the three figures—I mean, of
??? ????? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????? ?????. ??? ??? ??? the pyramid, and of the octahedron, and of the cube—
?? ????? ??? ????? ????? ?????????? ?? ?????? ????? are in rational ratios to one another. And (the sides
????? ? ??, ????????? ? ??? ?? ???????? ?????, ? ?? ?? of) the remaining two (figures)—I mean, of the icosahe?????????? ??? ?? ?? ????? ??? ????? ????? ?????????? dron, and of the dodecahedron—are neither in rational
?? ?????? ????? ????? ? ??? ?????? ??? ? ?? ??? ??. ratios to one another, nor to the (sides) of the aforemen??? ?? ? ?? ?? ??? ?????? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? [??? ?? tioned (three figures). For they are irrational (straight?? ?????? ????? ? ??]. ????? ??? ? ?? ?????? ???? lines): (namely), a minor [Prop. 13.16], and an apotome
??? ??????????? ?????? ???? ??? ?? ??????? ????? ??? [Prop. 13.17].
???????????? ???? ???? ??????. (And), we can show that the side, MB, of the icosahedron is greater that the (side), NB, or the dodecahedron,
as follows.
For, since triangle FDB is equiangular to triangle
FAB [Prop. 6.8], proportionally, as DB is to BF, so BF
(is) to BA [Prop. 6.4]. And since three straight-lines are
(continually) proportional, as the first (is) to the third,
536
STOIQEIWN igþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 13
so the (square) on the first (is) to the (square) on the
second [Def. 5.9, Prop. 6.20 corr.]. Thus, as DB is to
BA, so the (square) on DB (is) to the (square) on BF.
Thus, inversely, as AB (is) to BD, so the (square) on
FB (is) to the (square) on BD. And AB (is) triple BD.
Thus, the (square) on FB (is) three times the (square)
on BD. And the (square) on AD is also four times the
(square) on DB. For AD (is) double DB. Thus, the
(square) on AD (is) greater than the (square) on FB.
Thus, AD (is) greater than FB. Thus, AL is much greater
than FB. And KL is the greater piece of AL, which is
cut in extreme and mean ratio—inasmuch as LK is (the
side) of the hexagon, and KA (the side) of the decagon
[Prop. 13.9]. And NB is the greater piece of FB, which
is cut in extreme and mean ratio. Thus, KL (is) greater
than NB. And KL (is) equal to LM. Thus, LM (is)
greater than NB [and MB is greater than LM]. Thus,
MB, which is (the side) of the icosahedron, is much
greater than NB, which is (the side) of the dodecahedron. (Which is) the very thing it was required to show.

???? ??, ??? ???? ?? ???????? ????? ??????? ?? ??- So, I say that, beside the five aforementioned figures,
?????????? ?????? ????? ???????????? ??? ?????????? ?? no other (solid) figure can be constructed (which is) con??? ????????? ???? ????????. tained by equilateral and equiangular (planes), equal to
???? ??? ??? ??? ???????? ? ???? ???????? ?????? one another.
????? ?? ??????????. ??? ?? ????? ???????? ? ??? ??- For a solid angle cannot be constructed from two tri???????, ??? ?? ???????? ? ??? ?????????, ??? ?? ????? angles, or indeed (two) planes (of any sort) [Def. 11.11].
? ??? ???????????? ??? ?? ?? ???????? ?????????? ?? And (the solid angle) of the pyramid (is constructed)
??? ????????? ???? ??? ?????? ???????????? ??? ????? from three (equiangular) triangles, and (that) of the oc?????? ?????? ????? ??? ??? ??? ?????????? ???????? tahedron from four (triangles), and (that) of the icosahe?????? ???????? ????? ??????? ?? ?? ????????? ?????? ????? dron from (five) triangles. And a solid angle cannot be
???? ????????? ????? ??? ?????? ????? ??? ????????? (made) from six equilateral and equiangular triangles set
? ???????? ????? ?????????. ??? ?? ???? ?? ???? ??? up together at one point. For, since the angles of a equi???????? ? ?? ?????? ???????? ?????? ????? ??????????. lateral triangle are (each) two-thirds of a right-angle, the
??? ?? ?????????? ????? ? ??? ????? ????? ??????????? (sum of the) six (plane) angles (containing the solid an??? ?? ???????? ????????? ??????? ??? ????? ???????? gle) will be four right-angles. The very thing (is) impos?????. ??? ?? ?????????? ?????????? ??? ?????????, ??? sible. For every solid angle is contained by (plane angles
??? ????? ? ??? ???????????? ??? ?? ???????? ????????? whose sum is) less than four right-angles [Prop. 11.21].
????? ??? ??? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ????? So, for the same (reasons), a solid angle cannot be con??? ???????, ??????? ?? ???????? ?????? ???????? ????? structed from more than six plane angles (equal to two???????? ???? ????????. ???? ??? ??? ????????? ?????? thirds of a right-angle) either. And the (solid) angle of
???????? ?????????????? ?????? ????? ??? ?? ???? ???- a cube is contained by three squares. And (a solid angle
???. contained) by four (squares is) impossible. For, again, the
??? ??? ???? ?? ???????? ????? ??????? ?????? ????? (sum of the plane angles containing the solid angle) will
??????? ???????????? ??? ?????????? ?? ??? ????????? be four right-angles. And (the solid angle) of a dodec????????????? ???? ???? ??????. ahedron (is contained) by three equilateral and equiangular pentagons. And (a solid angle contained) by four
537
STOIQEIWN igþ. ELEMENTS BOOK 13
(equiangular pentagons is) impossible. For, the angle of
an equilateral pentagon being one and one-fifth of rightangle, four (such) angles will be greater (in sum) than
four right-angles. The very thing (is) impossible. And,
on account of the same absurdity, a solid angle cannot
be constructed from any other (equiangular) polygonal
figures either.
Thus, beside the five aforementioned figures, no other
solid figure can be constructed (which is) contained by
equilateral and equiangular (planes). (Which is) the very
thing it was required to show.

???? ?? ? ??? ?????????? ??? ????????? ?????????? It can be shown that the angle of an equilateral and

????? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ??? ????????? ?? angle, as follows.
?????, ??? ???????????? ???? ???? ?????? ? ?????, For let ABCDE be an equilateral and equiangular

????? ?????? ????????? ?????? ???? ???? ??? ????? ????, ??? and FE have been joined. Thus, they cut the angles
??? ?????, ?? ? ??? ???, ???? ????? ???? ???? ???????? of the pentagon in half at (points) A, B, C, D, and E
?????? ??? ?? ??? ???, ??? ???? ????? ????? ??? ???????. [Prop. 1.4]. And since the five angles at F are equal (in
